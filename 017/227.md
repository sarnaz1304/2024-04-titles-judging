# Faulty Division Operation that could lead to potential logical errors.

## Summary
In Solidity, as in many programming languages, multiplication and division have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right. This report aims to analyze the warning, its implications, and the recommended solution to ensure the correct execution of the smart contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
A division operation precedes multiplication operations in the code, which could lead to unexpected results due to the way integer division truncates in Solidity.
The specific line of code causing this is: **_protocolShare = protocolFee * protocolFeeshareBps / MAX_BPS;_**


## Impact
Any division operation has the potential to lead to imprecise results in cases where the inputs are variable. Rounding errors may ultimately lead to unintended calculations and even exploits of smart contract logic as a result.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The multiplication should be performed before the division. This can be achieved by adding parentheses to explicitly specify the order of operations. 
The corrected line of code should be:  **_protocolShare = (protocolFee * protocolFeeshareBps) / MAX_BPS;_**
