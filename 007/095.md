# Edition does not support ERC1155 interfaceId

## Summary

Editions do not support the interface Id for ERC1155. As a result, Edition fails to implement the ERC1155 standard correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

Edition inherits from `ERC2981` first and `ERC1155` second (from right to left):

```solidity
contract Edition is IEdition, ERC1155, ERC2981, Initializable, OwnableRoles { 
    ...
}
```

As such, the `super` keyword will refer to `ERC2981` and not `ERC1155`. The function `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)` will return `false` for `interfaceId = ERC1155 = 0xd9b67a26` or `interfaceId = ERC1155MetadataURI = 0x0e89341c`:

```solidity
    /// @notice Check if the contract supports the given interface.
    /// @param interfaceId The interface ID to check.
    /// @return True if the contract supports the interface, false otherwise.
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
        public
        view
        override(IEdition, ERC1155, ERC2981)
        returns (bool)
    {
        return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
```


## Impact

The Edition contract does not respect the [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) as it does not correctly implement `supportsInterface(bytes4)`.

Readme states:

> Is the codebase expected to comply with any EIPs? Can there be/are there any deviations from the specification?

> strict implementation of EIPs
> 1271 (Graph), 712 (Graph, Edition), 2981 (Edition), 1155 (Edition)

## Recommendation

Replace the return value with: `return (super(ERC1155)supportsInterface(interfaceId) || super(ERC2981)supportsInterface(interfaceId))`.
