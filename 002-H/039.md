# A user can mint a token and get back the referrer share fee

## Summary

When minting a token, the user submits the `referrer` parameter. This address will receive a part of the protocol share fee. A malicious user is able to get back a portion of his payment submitting his address as a `referrer`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Any user who wants to mint a token calling `mintWithComment` or `mint` functions can submit his own address or any controlled address as a `referrer` parameter. When processing the minting request, the protocol fee is splitted within the `_splitProtocolFee` function. 

This way, the malicious user will receive back 50% of the protocolShare.
This amount is actually 75%, this is discussed in another submitted issue.

## Impact

A malicious user is able to illegitimately get back part of the protocol share fee while minting a token.

## Code Snippet

- `mint`and `mintWithComment` function does not check `referrer` paramter

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider establishing a whitelist of `referrer` upon specific criteria and check that the submitted `referrer` is whitelisted.
