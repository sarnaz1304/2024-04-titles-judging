# Incorrect routing of collection fees in `FeeManager::_splitProtocolFee`

## Summary

`FeeManager::_splitProtocolFee` incorrectly routes the collection referrer's share of the fees to the mint referrer instead of the intended collection referrer.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue arises due to the misuse of the `referrer_` parameter in the `FeeManager::_splitProtocolFee` function. This parameter is incorrectly used for routing both the mint referrer and collection referrer shares. Specifically, the function fails to differentiate between the individual who referred the minting of a specific token (`referrer_`) and the entity responsible for referring the entire collection (contained in the `referrers` mapping), leading to potential misallocation of fees.

## Impact

This causes improper distribution of fees between involved parties, causing a disbalance in protocol's parties' funding.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To rectify this vulnerability, the routing logic within `_splitProtocolFee` should properly route collection referrer's fee share as follows:

```diff
_route(
    Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
-   Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
+   Target({target: referrers[edition_], chainId: block.chainid}),
    payer_
);
```
