# Mint referrers get 75% of protocol fee shares instead of 50%, causing collection referrers to lose funds

## Summary
TITLES protocol allows users to set referrals, so they are able to get protocol share. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The developer commented the following:
```solidity
        // In both cases, the protocol and edition shares may be split as follows:
        // - Protocol Share
        //   - If a referred mint, mint referrer gets 50% of the protocol share
        //   - If a referred collection, collection referrer gets 25% of the protcol share //@audot
        //   - Protocol fee receiver gets the remainder of the protocol share
        // - Edition Share
        //   - Attributions equally split 25% of the edition share, if applicable
        //   - Creator gets the remainder of the edition share
```
The referred amount is sent to the wrong referrer. This means that the mint referrer gets 75% of protocol fee share and collection referrer gets 0%. Losing out on fees earned.
```solidity
    function _splitProtocolFee( 
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
-- SNIP --
        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),//25%
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}), //@audit-issue wrong referrer, this should be collection referrers[edition_]
            payer_
        );
```
## Impact
Collection referrers will never get the 25% protocol fee shares.
