# Edition::mintBatch doesn't allow for referral address passing

## Summary

`Edition::mintBatch()` doesn't contain a `referrer` address parameter that can be passed into the function by intergraton partners or general referers. This goes against the design of the system, such has `Edition::mint()` which does allow for `referrer` passing.

## Vulnerability Detail

When [Edition::mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L228-L242) is called users are able to pass in `referrer_` that will receive some referal fees for protocol integrations, etc: 

```solidity
    function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```

However, [Edition::mintBatch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L277-L289) missed this input parameter and passed `address(0)` as the referrer:

```solidity
    function mintBatch(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
            FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
            );
```

This means that the referrer functionality cannot be utilised for the batch minting functions, which seems to go against the project design.

## Impact

Projects integrating with Titles will be less incentivised to integrate the batch minting functions as they will not receive any referral fees for this. This can limit the adoption of Titles.

## Recommendation

Add the `referred_` parameter to the batch minting functions to allow referres to get fees for utilising those functions.
