# `collectionReferrerShare` and `mintReferrerShare` goes to the same address

## Summary
In the `FeeManager.sol::_splitProtocolFee` function, the `collectionReferrerShare` and `mintReferrerShare` go to the same person.
## Vulnerability Detail
The  `collectionReferrerShare` and `mintReferrerShare` go to the same person in `FeeManager.sol::_splitProtocolFee` function.

In the above screenshot, it is clearly stated by the sponsor that `collectionReferrerShare` goes to the `collectionReferrer` and `mintReferrerShare` goes to the `mintReferrer` (see point 5), but there is no mechanism in the protocol to separate the collectionReferrer and mintRefferer and the both the fee goes to the same person.
```solidity
function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
        // The creation and mint referrers earn 25% and 50% of the protocol's share respectively, if applicable
        uint256 mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount_, referrer_); //50%
        uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]); //25%
        referrerShare = mintReferrerShare + collectionReferrerShare; //75% (50+25)%

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: amount_ - referrerShare}),  //25%
            Target({target: protocolFeeReceiver, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}), //50%    
@>          Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),   //mintReferrerShare goes to referrer_
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),  //25%
@>          Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),   //collectionReferrerShare again goes to the same referrer_
            payer_
        );
    }
```
In the above code, you can see both the `collectionReferrerShare` and `mintReferrerShare` gets routed to the same person only.

The issue has been further confirmed by the sponsor.
## Impact
The above bug breaks core contract functionality as both the referrers can't be separated and both the shares go to the same person.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A number of changes need to be made to the protocol to allow two referrers getting their respective fee. In the end, the `FeeManager.sol::_splitProtocolFee` function should look like this.
```solidity
function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address mintReferrer_,
        address collectionReferrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
        // The creation and mint referrers earn 25% and 50% of the protocol's share respectively, if applicable
        uint256 mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount_, referrer_); //50%
        uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]); //25%
        referrerShare = mintReferrerShare + collectionReferrerShare; //75% (50+25)%

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: amount_ - referrerShare}),  //25%
            Target({target: protocolFeeReceiver, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}), //50%    
            Target({target: mintReferrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),   
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),  //25%
            Target({target: CollectionReferrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),   
            payer_
        );
    }
```
