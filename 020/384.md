# Potential Precision Loss in Protocol Share Value

## Summary

The contract is susceptible to potential precision loss in the protocol share value calculation, which could result in inaccuracies and financial losses. This vulnerability arises due to the disparity in the range of possible values between `revshareBps` and `attributionShares`, leading to unexpected behavior when calculating the protocol share value.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability occurs in the calculation of `attributionRevShare`, where `revshareBps` is multiplied by 100 and divided by `attributionShares`. Since `revshareBps` is limited to a range between 95000 and 250, and `attributionShares` is casted to a uint32 with a maximum value of 4,294,967,295, there is a high likelihood of precision loss when `attributionShares` exceeds the available range of `revshareBps * 100`. This can lead to incorrect calculation results, where even small fractional values are rounded down to zero, resulting in a protocol share value of zero.

## Impact

The precision loss in the protocol share value calculation can have a significant impact on the distribution of rewards within the protocol. Incorrect calculation results may lead to undervaluation or overvaluation of protocol shares, potentially causing financial losses for stakeholders and impacting the overall stability and fairness of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate the potential precision loss in the protocol share value calculation and ensure accurate distribution of rewards, the following mitigation is recommended:

### Introduce a Multiplier to Ensure Range Compatibility

Implement a multiplier that adjusts the calculation of `attributionRevShare` based on the ratio between `revshareBps` and `attributionShares`. This multiplier ensures that the value of `revshareBps * 100` is always greater than `attributionShares`, preventing precision loss and inaccuracies in the calculation.

```solidity

uint32 attributionRevShare = revshareBps*100 * multiplier / uint32(attributionShares);
uint32 creatorShare = 1e6 - ((attributionRevShare * attributionShares)/multiplier);
```
