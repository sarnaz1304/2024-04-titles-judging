# Contract will not work on Degen Network

## Summary
Due to `0xSplits` not supporting `Degen`Network, Titles will not be able operate on `Degen` Network.
## Vulnerability Detail
As per the docs, the Sponsor is planning to deploy on the following chains:
```javascript
//On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
//Ethereum, Base, OP, Zora, Blast, Arbitrum, zkSync, Degen
```
The problem is that one of the external protocols that is used by the Sponsor, 0xSplits, does not have their contracts deployed on Degen Network:
[deployed contracts](https://docs.splits.org/core/split#addresses)

As per the [public message](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1231982888266895372/1233067984684187690) of the Sponsor:
```javascript
//Splits is a 3rd party, their contracts are already audited and deployed and are out of scope.
```
The deployed contracts of `0xSplits` will be used. For example, `createSplit()` is called on one of the deployed contracts of `0xSplits` during the `createRoute()`function, which is critical to the working of this project:
```javascript
    /// @notice Creates a new fee route for the given {Edition} and attributions.
    /// @param edition_ The {Edition} for which to create the route.
    /// @param tokenId_ The token ID associated with the route.
    /// @param attributions_ The attributions to be associated with the route.
    /// @param referrer_ The address of the referrer to receive a share of the fee.
    function createRoute(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        Target[] calldata attributions_,
        address referrer_
    ) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) returns (Target memory receiver) {
        Target memory creator = edition_.node(tokenId_).creator;

        if (attributions_.length == 0) {
            // No attributions, pay the creator directly
            receiver = creator;
        } else {
            // Distribute the fee among the creator and attributions
            (address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory revshares) = _buildSharesAndTargets(
                creator, attributions_, edition_.feeStrategy(tokenId_).revshareBps
            );

// Create the split. The protocol retains "ownership" to enable future use cases.
            // @audit this process seems odd
            receiver = Target({
->              target: splitFactory.createSplit(
                    SplitV2Lib.Split({
                        recipients: targets,
                        allocations: revshares,
                        totalAllocation: 1e6,
                        distributionIncentive: 0
                    }),
                    address(this),
                    creator.target
                    ),
                chainId: creator.chainId
            });
        }

        _feeReceivers[getRouteId(edition_, tokenId_)] = receiver;
        referrers[edition_] = referrer_;
    }
```
Given that the required contracts are not deployed on Degen Network, these function calls will not work.
## Impact
Titles will not be able to function on Degen Network.
