# Incompatible with zkSync and Degen chains deployment

## Summary

Titles protocol is incompatible with the planned deployment on zkSync and Degen chains because Splits, which is a core dependence of Titles, isn't deployed on these two chains.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol README states that Titles is planned to be deployed on multiple chains:

> #### Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
> Ethereum, Base, OP, Zora, Blast, Arbitrum, zkSync, Degen

However, [according to Split documentation](https://docs.splits.org/core/split), this protocol isn't deployed on zkSync and Degen: 

> Ethereum - 1
> Optimism – 10
> BSC – 56
> Gnosis – 100
> Polygon – 137
> Fantom – 250
> Base – 8453
> Arbitrum – 42161
> Avalanche – 43114
> Zora – 7777777
> Aurora – 1313161554
> Blast – 81457

Therefore, Titles can be deployed on those two chains but will be unusable because all calls to `TitlesCore.createEdition()` and `TitlesCore.publish()` will fail because they ultimately call `FeeManager.createRoute()` which itself will call an inexistent contract `splitFactory.createSplit()`.

```solidity
    /// @notice Creates a new fee route for the given {Edition} and attributions.
    /// @param edition_ The {Edition} for which to create the route.
    /// @param tokenId_ The token ID associated with the route.
    /// @param attributions_ The attributions to be associated with the route.
    /// @param referrer_ The address of the referrer to receive a share of the fee.
    function createRoute(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        Target[] calldata attributions_,
        address referrer_
    ) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) returns (Target memory receiver) {
        Target memory creator = edition_.node(tokenId_).creator;

        if (attributions_.length == 0) {
            // No attributions, pay the creator directly
            receiver = creator;
        } else {
            // Distribute the fee among the creator and attributions
            (address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory revshares) = _buildSharesAndTargets(
                creator, attributions_, edition_.feeStrategy(tokenId_).revshareBps
            );

            // Create the split. The protocol retains "ownership" to enable future use cases.
            receiver = Target({
❌              target: splitFactory.createSplit(
                    SplitV2Lib.Split({
                        recipients: targets,
                        allocations: revshares,
                        totalAllocation: 1e6,
                        distributionIncentive: 0
                    }),
                    address(this),
                    creator.target
                    ),
                chainId: creator.chainId
            });
        }

        _feeReceivers[getRouteId(edition_, tokenId_)] = receiver;
        referrers[edition_] = referrer_;
    }
```

## Impact

Incompatible with the chains on which it is to be deployed.

## Recommendation

Don't deploy on zkSync and Degen until Splits protocol is deployed on both chains.
