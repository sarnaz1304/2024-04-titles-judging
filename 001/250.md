# [M-02] Edition.sol:mint() #L228 user can mint and refer himself to avoid paying full fee

## Summary
function mint() does not check if user refers himself. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The function does not have the proper checks in place to prohibit self-referring. 

## Likelihood
Medium, because it requires user to interact from smart contract directly.

## Impact
Medium, because it can lead to limited amount of funds lost for the protocol ( half of ref fee ).

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L228

Just add this to Edition.t.sol

    receive() external payable {}
    
    function test_mint_new() public {
        uint256 initialSenderBalance = address(this).balance;
        edition.mint{value: 0.0106 ether}(
            address(1),
            1,
            1,
            address(this),
            new bytes(0)
        );
        uint256 FinalSenderBalance = address(this).balance;
        assertEq(edition.totalSupply(1), 1);
        assertEq(initialSenderBalance - FinalSenderBalance, 0.0103 ether);
        assertEq(address(0xc0ffee).balance, 0.0003 ether);
    }

## Tool used
VS Code

## Recommendation
add a require check to Edition.sol

      function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
    require(msg.sender != referrer_, 'self-referring not allowed');
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );
        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
