# `mintBatch` is unusable when minting multiple tokens

## Summary

`mintBatch` will revert during its second round of loop, because of a lack of ETH balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

**Context:** the `Edition` contract ETH balance is expected to be `0` when no transaction is executed, as excess of balance is refunded (see `_refundExcess`) function.

The `mintBatch` function allows to mint multiple tokens in a given `Edition` contract. It loops through the `tokenIds` to collect mint fees.

However, it will send `msg.value` to the fee manager at each round of the loop. The first round will successfully send this `msg.value`. Every other rounds will fail because the `Edition` contract balance is lower than `msg.value`.

## Impact

`mintBatch` can't be used to mint multiple tokens.

## Code Snippet

[The `mintBatch` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L277-L297) loops through the token IDs, and [it calls `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee` at each round of the loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L287-L289).

```solidity
    function mintBatch(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
            FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(// @POC: will revert on 2nd iteration
                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
            );

            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }
```

- Before the transaction: `Edition` ETH balance = 0
- Before the 1st round: `Edition` ETH balance = msg.value
- After 1st round: `Edition` ETH balance = msg.value - msg.value = 0
- During 2nd round: `Edition` ETH balance = 0 - msg.value = **REVERT**

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A way to fix the issue is to add an input parameter: an array with the ETH value for each token Id.

Then:
- `msg.value == sum(ETH_values)` must be checked
- `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: ETH_values[i]}` must be used
