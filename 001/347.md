# No mechanism to refund excess `msg.value` in the function `collectCreationFee()`

## Summary
If users, pass an amount greater than the `creationFee` as `msg.value`, then there is no mechanism to return the excess amount back to the user.
## Vulnerability Detail
User calls `publish()` which is payable to publish a new work in an edition. the function then calls the invokes the FeeManager, calling the function `collectCreationFee()` in order to collect the creation fee for publishing the work. The collectCreationFee` function calls the `getCreationFee` function, which returns the `asset(ETH)` and the `amount(protocolCreationFee)`. The issue here is that in a situation where the user passes a value `greater` than the `protocolCreationFee`, the excess amount will not be refunded as there is no mechanism for refunding the excess. 


## Impact
Users will be unable to get their assets back.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function collectCreationFee(IEdition edition_, uint256 tokenId_, address feePayer_)
        external
        payable
    {
        Fee memory fee = getCreationFee();
        if (fee.amount == 0) return;

        _route(fee, Target({target: protocolFeeReceiver, chainId: block.chainid}), feePayer_);
        emit FeeCollected(address(edition_), tokenId_, ETH_ADDRESS, fee.amount, 0);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement the `refundExcess()` funtion used in the Edition.sol here so that users can automatically get their excess amount back.
```solidity
function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
