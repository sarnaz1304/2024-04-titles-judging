# Excess minting fee is not refunded to the user

## Summary

The `mint` function fails to refund excess ETH sent over the required minting fee due to an oversight in the fee handling process within the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `mint` function is designed to collect minting fees and issue tokens. It sends the entire `msg.value`, which is the ETH provided by the user, to the `FEE_MANAGER` to collect fees. This design fails to account for any excess ETH beyond the actual minting fee, as all `msg.value` is transferred, leaving the contract balance at zero.

```solidity
    function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```

However, the `_refundExcess` function attempts to refund any remaining balance to the user, but since the contract balance is zero after the fee transfer, no refund occurs:

```solidity
    function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```

The impact exits in other functions such as `mintWithComment` and `mintBatch` as well.

## Impact

This issue leads to users losing excess ETH sent for minting beyond the required fees, affecting trust and usability of the platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a precise fee calculation before calling `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee`. Only the calculated fee should be sent to the `FEE_MANAGER` contract, ensuring any excess ETH remains in the contract's balance, allowing the `_refundExcess` function to properly refund the user.
