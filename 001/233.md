# A new work publisher might lose the left ETH since of no refund functionality, which will be locked in FeeManger.

## Summary
A new work publisher might lose unexpected ETH because there is not refunding for left ETHs.

## Vulnerability Detail
The work publisher calls `TitlesCore.sol::publish()` which in turn calls `_publish() -> feeManager.collectCreationFee()`.
This function will collect protocolCreationFee which is defined in FeeMananger. The fee can be changed by owner's calling of setter function (`setProtocolFees()`).
If the fee has been changed(decreased) by owner while publish transaction is pending, the left funds are remained in FeeManager contract and locked

## Impact
The work publisher's funds are locked in contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend to refund the left balance functionality in `FeeManage::collectCreationFee()` (FeeManager -> TitlesCore), and `TitlesCore::publish()` (TtilesCore -> msg.sender).
