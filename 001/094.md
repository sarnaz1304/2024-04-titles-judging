# Edition creation fee is taken on publishing of work

## Summary

The fee designed to be taken when creating a new Edition is also taken when an edition is already created but a new token is published.

## Vulnerability Detail

As written in the comments of `getCreationFee()`, and `protocolCreationFee`, the creation fee is supposed to be taken when a user creates a new Edition:

```solidity
    /// @notice The protocol creation fee. This fee is collected when a new {Edition} is created.
    uint128 public protocolCreationFee = 0.0001 ether;

    /// @notice Calculates the fee for creating a new {Edition}.
    /// @return fee The {Fee} for creating a new {Edition}.
    /// @dev The creation fee is a flat fee collected by the protocol when a new {Edition} is created.
    function getCreationFee() public view returns (Fee memory fee) {
        return Fee({asset: ETH_ADDRESS, amount: protocolCreationFee});
    }
```

However, publishing a new work within an existing edition also pays out the creation fee:

```solidity
    /// @notice Publishes a new Work in the given {Edition} using the given payload.
    /// @param edition_ The {Edition} to publish the Work in.
    /// @param payload_ The compressed payload for publishing the Work. See {WorkPayload}.
    /// @param referrer_ The address of the referrer.
    /// @return tokenId The token ID of the new Work.
    function publish(Edition edition_, bytes calldata payload_, address referrer_)
        external
        payable
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        if (!edition_.hasAnyRole(msg.sender, EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE)) {
            revert Unauthorized();
        }
        WorkPayload memory payload = abi.decode(payload_.cdDecompress(), (WorkPayload));
        return _publish(edition_, payload, referrer_);
    }

    /// @notice Publishes a new Work in the given {Edition} using the given payload.
    /// @param edition_ The {Edition} to publish the Work in.
    /// @param work_ The payload for publishing the Work. See {EditionPayload}.
    /// @param referrer_ The address of the referrer.
    /// @return tokenId The token ID of the new Work.
    function _publish(Edition edition_, WorkPayload memory work_, address referrer_)
        internal
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        // Publish the new Work in the Edition
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        tokenId = edition_.publish(
            work_.creator.target,
            work_.maxSupply,
            work_.opensAt,
            work_.closesAt,
            work_.attributions,
            work_.strategy,
            work_.metadata
        );

        // Collect the creation fee
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        feeManager.collectCreationFee{value: msg.value}(edition_, tokenId, msg.sender);  // @audit pays out creation fee

        // Create the fee route for the new Work
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        Target memory feeReceiver = feeManager.createRoute(
            edition_, tokenId, _attributionTargets(work_.attributions), referrer_
        );

        // Set the royalty target for the new Work
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        edition_.setRoyaltyTarget(tokenId, feeReceiver.target);
    }
```

## Impact

Publisher of new works within an existing Edition may not be aware that they will pay a creation fee. They will lose funds by paying a fee they are not aware of.

## Recommendation

Only collect creation fee on Edition creation or change comments / documentation.
