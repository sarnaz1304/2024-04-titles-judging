# Malicious editions can be created to publish works and perform all sort of attacks

## Summary

`TitlesCore::publish()` does not validate if the `edition_` argument was created by `TitlesCore`, allowing works to be published through a malicious `Edition`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`TitlesCore::publish()` only validates that `msg.sender` has the `EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE` in the `_edition` but does not check if the `_edition` was created by `TitlesCore`. Thus, users may create malicious editions in an attempt to game the protocol or users. For example, they may create a malicious edition that does not charge fees through `FeeManager::collectMintFee()` on `mint`, but sends directly to the `creator` instead, for the loss of the protocol.

## Impact

Loss of revenue for the protocol, spoof attacks for users and credibility.

## Code Snippet

[TitlesCore::publish()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol#L103) does not validate the `edition_`.
```solidity
function publish(Edition edition_, bytes calldata payload_, address referrer_)
    external
    payable
    returns (uint256 tokenId)
{
    if (!edition_.hasAnyRole(msg.sender, EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE)) {
        revert Unauthorized();
    }
    WorkPayload memory payload = abi.decode(payload_.cdDecompress(), (WorkPayload));
    return _publish(edition_, payload, referrer_);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

Vscode

## Recommendation

When creating an edition, set a mapping to true, `_isValidEdition[edition] = true;`.
Then, when publishing works, check if the mapping is set `if (!_isValidEdition[edition_]) revert InvalidEdition()`.
