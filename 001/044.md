# `mintBatch` function does not collect the right amount of fees

## Summary

The second `mintBatch` function, which is meant to mint a token to a set of receivers for a given work,  does not collect the right amount of fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

The second `mintBatch` function starts by collecting the total fees for the minting process. However the submitted amount of tokens to mint does not account for the total number of receivers.

## Impact

The total amount of fees collected will not depend on the number of receivers.
Creator, referrer, and protocol will receive significantly less fees than expected.

## Code Snippet

- The `mintBatch` function collects fees for the `amount` of tokens minting **per** receiver

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the `amount` parameter of the `collectMintFee` function to account for the number of receivers:
```solidity

FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
    this, tokenId_, amount_ * receivers_.length, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
);
```
