# `createEdition` can be front run to get control of the publish of work of edition and steal mint fee

## Summary
`createEdition` can be front run to get control of the publish of work of edition and steal mint fee
## Vulnerability Detail
When user call `createEdition`, attacker can see tx in mempool and change `payload.work.creator.target` with his address. `payload.work.creator.target` is owner of edition contract and is granted `EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE`. The publish of work in edition will be controlled by attacker. Both the owner and `TitleCore` have the right to grant and revoke `EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE` role. Attacker also can change `referrer_` with his address and steal mint fee. The attacker only pay protocolCreationFee(0.0001 ether) which is very small. 
Metadate is already on-chain, if user create editon again, there maybe has copyright disputes.
## Impact
1. attacker can get access to publish work in edition
2. attacker can set `referrer_`  with his address and steal mint fee

```diff
    function createEdition(bytes calldata payload_, address referrer_)
        external
        payable
        returns (Edition edition)
    {
        EditionPayload memory payload = abi.decode(payload_.cdDecompress(), (EditionPayload));

+       if (msg.sender != payload.work.creator.target) {
+           revert Unauthorized();
+       }        

       edition = Edition(editionImplementation.clone());

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        edition.initialize(
            feeManager, graph, payload.work.creator.target, address(this), payload.metadata
        );

        // wake-disable-next-line unchecked-return-value
        _publish(edition, payload.work, referrer_);

        emit EditionCreated(
            address(edition),
            payload.work.creator.target,
            payload.work.maxSupply,
            payload.work.strategy,
            abi.encode(payload.metadata)
        );
    }
