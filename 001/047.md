# A user can steal stuck `ETH` in a `Edition` contract

## Summary

If a user mistakenly sends `ETH` funds to the `Edition` contract. A malicious user can withdraw these `ETH`.

## Vulnerability Detail

If `ETH` are sent to an `Edition` contract out of the context of minting a new item, any user can withdraw these funds just by minting one item. This is possible because, at the end of a minting process, the `refundExcess` function is executed and sends any remaining funds in the contract to the current caller.

## Impact

Any user can steal stuck `ETH` in a `Edition` contract.

## Code Snippet

- At the end of each minting function, `refundExcess` function is called

- Any remaining `ETH` after the minting process is sent to the `msg.sender`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Create a `withdraw` function restricted to an ADMIN to help rescue stuck ETH.
- Modify the `refundExcess` function to refund any excess of funds based on the balance at the start of the call. Be aware that `msg.value` is already accounted in the balance of the contract and that it should be deducted to save the contract balance at start.
