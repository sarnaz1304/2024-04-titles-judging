# `Edition.sol`'s mint functions don't refund excess funds to minters

## Summary
Minter who decides to set bigger msg.value than expected will meet loss of funds

## Vulnerability Detail
Here you possible scenario: 

1. User decides to mint new Edition token by executing `Edition.sol::mint` and to be sure the transaction won't revert, he sends more ETH than expected
2. `Edition.sol::mint` calls `FeeManager::collectMintFee`, which does not return any exceeded funds, left from the fees collected from `Edition.sol`'s `msg.value`
3. Due to this `Edition.sol::_refundExcess()` won't be executed and the exceeded funds are left in `FeeManager`

Note that in this scenario `Edition` have 0 balance

4. Finally other Users are able to mint tokens at cheaper price

## Impact
User loss of funds due to exceeded funds not returned

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement `_refundExcess()` function in `FeeManager.sol`
```solidity
function _refundExcess(uint256 excesses) internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(msg.value - excesses);
        }
    }
```
2. modify collectFee functions as shown below:
```diff
function collectMintFee(
        IEdition edition,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_,
        Strategy calldata strategy_
    ) external payable {
+      Fee fee = getMintFee(edition_, tokenId_, amount_)
        _collectMintFee(
-            edition, tokenId_, amount_, payer_, referrer_, getMintFee(strategy_, amount_)
+            edition, tokenId_, amount_, payer_, referrer_, fee
        );
+     _refundExcess(msg.value - fee.amount)
    }        
```
