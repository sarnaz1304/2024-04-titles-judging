# Promo minter role cannot be assigned

## Summary

The `EDITION_MINTER_ROLE` role used to enable access to the `promoMint()` function cannot be assigned since no entity can assign roles in the context of the Edition contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the Edition contract is initialized it assigns the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE`.

```solidity
function initialize(
    FeeManager feeManager_,
    TitlesGraph graph_,
    address owner_,
    address controller_,
    Metadata calldata metadata_
) external initializer {
    _initializeOwner(owner_);
    FEE_MANAGER = feeManager_;
    GRAPH = graph_;

    _grantRoles(controller_, EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE);
    _grantRoles(owner_, EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE);

    _metadata[0] = metadata_;
}
```

The `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` is given to the `controller_` argument, which is the TitlesCore contract.

The Edition contract also restricts access to role management. The default implementation of OwnableRoles lets the owner manage roles, but the Edition contract overrides this behavior:

```solidity
function grantRoles(address user_, uint256 roles_)
    public
    payable
    override
    onlyRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE)
{
    _grantRoles(user_, roles_);
}

/// @inheritdoc OwnableRoles
function revokeRoles(address user_, uint256 roles_)
    public
    payable
    override
    onlyRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE)
{
    _removeRoles(user_, roles_);
}
```

As we can see, role management is restricted to the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` role, leaving out the owner.

Since the TitlesCore contract cannot grant roles (because there's no functionality to do so) and the owner is left out of the management role, then there is no way to grant anyone the `EDITION_MINTER_ROLE`.

## Impact

The `EDITION_MINTER_ROLE` role cannot be assigned to anyone, crippling the promo mint functionality.

## Recommendation

Allow the owner to grant the `EDITION_MINTER_ROLE` role. Other roles can still be restricted.
