# mintBatch function in Edition is vulnerable to sybil attack

High
## Summary
`mintBatch` function in `Edition` is responsible for minting a token of work to a set of receivers, but doesn't calculate the `mintFee` correctly, leaving the protocol vulnerable to an attack where a malicious user puts his address multiple times in `receivers_` and ends up paying the mint fee for only one mint;

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function mintBatch(
        address[] calldata receivers_, //[address(user), address(user), address(user)]
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,  // 1
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy //<- amount should be multiplied by receivers_.length 
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_); //<- minthBatch will issue several works meanwhile the user only paid for one mint
        }

        _refundExcess();
    }
```
If malicious user calls `mintBatch` with `receivers_ = [address(user), address(user), address(user)]` and `amount_ =  1` user will pay a fee for one mint, but will receive 3 works.

## Impact
Loss of funds for the protocol

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `mintBatch` function change the call to fee manager to `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_ * receivers_.length, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy);`
