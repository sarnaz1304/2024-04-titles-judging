# Users can mint tokens for free in the second `mintBatch` function

## Summary

The second `mintBatch` function in Edition.sol enables users to 'Mint a token to a set of receivers for the given work'. The major issue here is that the mint fee is paid for only the first receiver, causing the rest of the token mints to be free.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
 function mintBatch(
      address[] calldata receivers_,
      uint256 tokenId_,
      uint256 amount_,
      bytes calldata data_
  ) external payable {
      // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
      FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
          this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
      );

      for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
          _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
      }

      _refundExcess();
  }
```

As we can see in the second `mintBatch` function, the `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee` is called only once for an `amount_` of `tokenId_`. Following that, all `receivers` are iterated through a for loop, where they are all issued an `amount_` of `tokenId_`.

Therefore, the mint fee is only paid for the first receiver, while all other receivers get the `amount_` of `tokenId_` for free.
For example:
    - `amount_` is equal to 100
    - `receivers_.length` = 10
    - user pays for only 100 tokens, while 100 * 10 are actually issued

## Impact

This will enable a malicious user to freely mint tokens for any work. Furthermore, the malicious user can easily mint enough tokens to reach the `maxSupply` limit

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perhaps, multiplying the `amount_` in `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee` by the number of receivers will be a sufficient fix:

```solidity
 FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
          this, tokenId_, amount_ * receivers_.length, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
      );
```
