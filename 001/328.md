# `mintBatch()` Allows Users To Mint Unlimited NFTs by Only Paying Fee of 1 NFT's Mint

## Summary
Users Can Mint Multiple NFTs With Only Paying 1 NFT's Mint Fee using the `mintBatch(address[] calldata receivers_, uint256 tokenId_, uint256 amount_, bytes calldata data_)` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are tow `mintBatch` functions, we are only conmcerned here about the one which allows a token's minting to multiple receivers:
```solidity
    function mintBatch(address[] calldata receivers_, uint256 tokenId_, uint256 amount_, bytes calldata data_) external payable {
        ///@audit-issue H Looks like users can use this to mint multiple nfts for almost free - PoC Worked!
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        }
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
This function takes an array of `receivers_` as an input and mint an NFT to all the addresses given in the array input. The `mintBatch` function first calls the `collectMintFee()` function of the `FEE_MANAGER` contract, which basically calculates NFT's minting fee and takes the fee from the user's account. 

### Issue
The problem is that, that the `mintBatch` calls the `collectMintFee()` function with the user inputted `amount_` variable and it is expected that the users will input the correct `amount_` number. Which allows users to bypass fee for multiple NFTs minting. A malicious user can come to mint 5 NFTs to multiple receivers but only give 1 input for `amount_`. Now, he will pay minting fee only for 1 NFT instead of paying fees for 5 mints.

An attacker exploit this vulnerabilty to mint unlimited NFTs to multiple addresses or even same address as show in the PoC:
### Proof-of-Concept 
```solidity
    function test_batchMint_MultipleNFTsMintingWithOneMintFee_PoC() public {
        address[] memory recievers = new address[](5);
        recievers[0] = address(1);
        recievers[1] = address(1);
        recievers[2] = address(1);
        recievers[3] = address(2);
        recievers[4] = address(5);

        edition.mintBatch{value: 0.0106 ether}(recievers, 1, 1, new bytes(0));  ///> Only 1 NFT Mint Fee
        assertEq(edition.totalSupply(1), 5);                                    ///> 5 NFTs Minted on 3 Multiple Addresses
    }
```
## Impact
- Unlimited NFTs minting by only paying fee for 1 NFT's mint

## Recommendation
I would suffest a team to find the best solution to this problem, but I guess the solution for this will be to not take `amount_` from the users and use `receivers_.length` instead:
```diff
    function mintBatch(
        address[] calldata receivers_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
-        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
-        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy);
+        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(this, tokenId_, receivers_.length, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        }

        _refundExcess();
    }
```
