# Attacker can avoid paying mint fee by using any ETH excesses in feemanager

## Summary
Attacker can avoid paying mint fee by using any ETH excesses in feemanager 

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can call mint with 0 msg.value if there is any excess excesses in feemanager  because the feemanager does not verify where enough fee was sent but uses it balance to pay making it possible that any excess in the feemanager be drain out.
```solidity
 function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
No verification if msg.value is actully up to the mint fee 
```solidity
  function collectMintFee(
        IEdition edition,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_,
        Strategy calldata strategy_
    ) external payable {
        _collectMintFee(
            edition, tokenId_, amount_, payer_, referrer_, getMintFee(strategy_, amount_)
        );
    }
```

## Impact
protocol wont be able to withdraw excess as it would all be drain out
