# Missing Referrer Checks in Mint Function Allow Minter to Recover Minting Fees

## Summary
In the Edition.sol contract's mint function, a minter has the ability to designate themselves as the referrer, resulting in the minter recovering 50% of the minting fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
**Consider this scenario:**
* Bob initiates the mint function and specifies his own address as the referrer_ parameter.
* This triggers the execution of the collectMintFees function within the FeeManager.sol contract.
* The collectMintFees function calculates the protocolFee using the formula: uint256 protocolFee = protocolFlatFee * amount_;.
* The protocolFee is then passed to the splitProtocolFee function to distribute the fees.
* Within the splitProtocolFee function, the following call is made:
```solidity
_route(
    Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
    Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
    payer_
);
```
* This call results in the minter, Bob, receiving 50% of the mintFee amount, potentially allowing him to mint double the amount for the same fee.

## Impact
Manipulating the mint Fee amount.

## Recommendation
Implement checks so that the minter is not the same as referrer_ or methods to verify referrers.
