# The user using Edition.sol::mintBatch(one token to multiple receivers) will avoid to pay expected mint Fee.

## Summary
Edition.sol::mintBatch(one token to multiple receivers) is paying fee for only param `amount_`, but total minted amount is `receivers_.length * amount_`

## Vulnerability Detail
If user mints the token's amount with `mint()` function, collected fee would be `receivers_.length * amount_ * (strategy_.mintFee + protocolFlatFee)`,
but with the mintBatch function, collected fee is only `amount_ * (strategy_.mintFee + protocolFlatFee)`.

## Impact
As a result, the protocol will get and distribute less than expected fee amounts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function needs to pass `receivers_.length * amount_` in FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee() function instead of `amount_`.
