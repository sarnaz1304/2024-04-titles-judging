# `mintBatch` minting function will always revert

## Summary

The first `mintBatch` function, which is meant to mint multiple tokens for a given work, will always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Edition` contract is not supposed to hold `ETH` in its balance. After a minting, the excess of funds is sent back to the user via the `_refundExcess` function.

The `mintBatch` function iterates through all the tokensIds to call the `collectMintFee` function.
However a value of the total `msg.value` is sent along the `collectMintFee` function for each iteration of the loop. As the contract does not hold funds, the execution will revert during the second iteration for trying to send over the current balance of the contract. 

In fact, the `msg.value` amount is not updated in the context of the execution of a transaction.


## Impact

 The `mintBatch` functionality will never work as is.

## Code Snippet

- The `mintBatch` function sends `msg.value` each iteration of the loop along the call to `collectMintFee` function

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Total minting fees for each `tokenId` should be calculated beforehand.
Then the specific `value` should be sent to the `collectMintFee` function.
