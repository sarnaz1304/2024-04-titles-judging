# mintBatch function doesn't work as expected

## Summary

The `mintBatch` function fails and causes a revert after the first iteration of the loop because it attempts to send the entire `msg.value` with each iteration, depleting it after the first use.

## Vulnerability Detail

During batch minting, the `mintBatch` function iterates through each `tokenId` and attempts to transfer the entire `msg.value` to the `FEE_MANAGER` for each tokenId. After the initial transaction, no funds remain for subsequent iterations, causing the function to revert in the second loop due to insuffiscient `msg.value`.

```solidity
    function mintBatch(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
            FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}( // @audit revert because tries to send msg.value each time
                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
            );

            _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
            _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
        }

        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```

## Impact

The `mintBatch` function is not functional under current conditions and reverts if multiple tokens are attempted to be minted in one transaction, limiting the usability of the batch minting feature.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the `mintBatch` function to send the total `msg.value` required for all tokens to the `FEE_MANAGER` prior to looping through the tokenIds
