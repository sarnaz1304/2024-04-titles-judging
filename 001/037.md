# _refundExcess doesn't work as expected in the protocol

## Summary
_refundExcess should refund the excess funds to users, but actually is is not.
## Vulnerability Detail
There are many entries for user in Edition contract to mint a token of a work (`mint`, `mintWithComment`, `mintBatch`, `mintBatch`).
All of them have called the function `_refundExcess` for refunding the user if any excess Ether is sent by user, but actually it is not working as expected by the protocol.
- Alice calls `mint` to issue a token of a work
- We assume the Alice has set 0.1 ETH extra (for example, total mint fee is 0.5 ETH, but Alice has set 0.6 ETH and 0.1 is excess)
```solidity
function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
- When it reaches to `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee`, all the Ethers will be forwarded to the function `collectMintFee` in `FeeManager` contract.
- `_issue` will mint the token for Alice
- When it reaches to `_refundExcess`:
```solidity
function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
because all the transaction Ethers have been forwarded to `collectMintFee`, so this function doesn't do anything and Alice will lose that 0.1 ETH.
## Impact
_refundExcess is unusable and doesn't work as intended which may lead to loss of funds for users.
