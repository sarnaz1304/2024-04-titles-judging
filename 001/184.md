# Excess mint fees are not returned to the minter as expected.

## Summary
Excess mint fees are transfered to the `FeeManager`, and are not returned to minter.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown in `Edition.mint`, when minting a new token for a work, one needs to pay a certain amount of ETH as the mint fee. If the ETH paid exceeds the mint fee, it is expected that the excess will be returned to the minter. However, the excess mint fees go to `FeeManager`, and are not refunded to the minter.
1. When `Edition.mint` is called, all the paid ETH are sent to `Edition`, so `Edition.balance = msg.value`.
2. On line 236, all the paid ETH (i.e. `msg.value`) are sent to `FeeManager` contract to collect mint fees, so `Edition.balance = 0`.
3. After collecting mint fees, `FeeManager.collectMintFee` does not refund excess mint fees to `Edition` contract, so `Edition.balance = 0`.
4. On line 241, there is no ETH to refund to minter, as `Edition.balance = 0`.
```solidity
228:    function mint(
229:        address to_,
230:        uint256 tokenId_,
231:        uint256 amount_,
232:        address referrer_,

234:    ) external payable override {
235:        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy

237:            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
238:        );
239:
240:        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
241:        _refundExcess();
242:    }
```

The following test case shows the problem (add it to `Edition.t.sol`).
```solidity
    function test_mint_refund() public {
        // balance before `mint`
        uint256 thisBalance1 = address(this).balance;
        uint256 feeManagerBalance1 = address(feeManager).balance;

        // mint fee should be 0.0106 ether
        assertEq(edition.mintFee(1), 0.0106 ether);

        // mint with 1.0106 ether, 1 ether should be refunded
        edition.mint{value: 1.0106 ether}(address(1), 1, 1, address(0), new bytes(0));
        assertEq(edition.totalSupply(1), 1);
        assertEq(address(1).balance, 0.01 ether);
        assertEq(address(0xc0ffee).balance, 0.0006 ether);

        // balance after `mint`
        uint256 thisBalance2 = address(this).balance;
        uint256 feeManagerBalance2 = address(feeManager).balance;

        // user paid 1.0106 ether, 1 ether is not refunded
        assertEq(thisBalance1 - thisBalance2, 1.0106 ether);

        // fee manager received the 1 ether
        assertEq(feeManagerBalance2 - feeManagerBalance1, 1 ether);
    }
```

This problem also exists for other mint functions (i.e. `Edition.mintWithComment` and `Edition.mintBatch`).

## Impact
Minters may suffer fee losses because excess minting fees are not returned to them as expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`FeeManager` refunds the excess mint fees to `Edition`, then `Edition` will refunds them to minter.
