# refunding excess ETH does not work properly

## Summary
`Edition.sol::_refundExcess` function tries to send excess ETH sent by the user back to the user after minting but as msg.value is sent to `FeeManager.sol` refunding is broken.
## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever a user mints tokens through `Edition.sol` msg.value will be [forwarded](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L236C1-L238C11) to `FeeManager.sol`, after minting and fee distribution is complete, Edition.sol will try to refund the excess ETH sent by the user but _refundExcess function only does this if `(msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0)`, because all msg.value has been forwarded to `FeeManager.sol` this if statement will never be true and all of the excess ETH will stay in `FeeManager.sol`. At this point users have the ability to call [collectMintFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L183C1-L193C6) to drain this ETH inside `FeeManager.sol`.
## Impact
Refunding excess ETH does not work, excess ETH sent can be stolen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider redesigning refund process, you could move refunding operation to `FeeManager.sol` passing in the minter, as you are already forwarding the msg.value to `FeeManager.sol`, refund from there.
