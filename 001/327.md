# `collectionReferrerShare` is sent to the wrong address

## Summary

`collectionReferrerShare` is intended to be 25% of the protocol share of fees, which need to be sent to the collection referrer. The issue is that they are currently transferred to the mint referrer.

## Vulnerability Detail

As the code comments state: `If a referred collection, collection referrer gets 25% of the protocol share`. Furthermore, the `collectionReferrerShare` is calculated based on the `referrers[edition_]`, which is essentially the collection referrer:

```solidity
uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]);
```

The problem occurs in the transfer of these fees:

```solidity
_route(
    Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
    Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
    payer_
);

_route(
    Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
    Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
    payer_
);
```

As we can see in `_splitProtocolFee` both the `mintReferrerShare` and the `collectionReferrerShare` are routed to the `referrer_`, and the `collectionReferrerShare` is not sent to the `referrers[edition_]`.

## Impact

The mint referrer is given the shares, allocated for the collection referrer, getting 75% of the protocol share of fees, instead of 50%, also causing a loss of funds for the collection referrer.

## Recommendation

Send the `collectionReferrerShare` to `referrers[edition_]`.
