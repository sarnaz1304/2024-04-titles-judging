# User could mint multiple works for the price of one

## Summary
User could mint multiple works for the price of one
## Vulnerability Detail
The particularity with `msg.value` is that it's value remains fixed during the whole function call. In the `mintBatch` function in `Edition.sol`, `msg.value` is used in a for loop, which means that if we send enough ETH to cover the minting of the most expensive `work`, we can also mint multiple other works.
## Impact
Exploits the protocol
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L277-L297
```Solidity
function mintBatch(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
            FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
            );

            _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
            _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
        }

        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```

## Recommendation
Don't use msg.value in a for loop
