# Mint referrer gets collection referrer's share

## Summary
Due to a coding error mint referrer gets collection referrer's share.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `FeeManager.sol` while splitting fees through `_splitProtocolFee` function, protocol fee should split between mint referrer, collection referrer and protocol accordingly. However after calculating how much each party will get, collection referrer's share is sent to mint referrer.
## Impact
Collection referrer's share is sent to mint referrer.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set collection referrer as the right target of collection referrer shares.
```diff
        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
-            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
+            Target({target: referrers[edition_], chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
```
