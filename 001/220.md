# `Edition` referrer never receives any fee, which goes to the `mint` referrer instead

## Summary

The protocol includes `Edtion` and `mint` referrers, which get a share of the protocol fee. However, there is a bug in `FeeManager::_splitProtocolFee()` that assigns the `Edition` referral fee to the `mint` referrer.

## Vulnerability Detail

In a mint in `Edition`, `FeeManager::collectMintFee()` is called to collect fees for the creator, protocol, mint and `Edition` referrers. In [FeeManager::_splitProtocolFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L412), the fees are split between the protocol, `Edition` and `mint` referrers. As can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L438), the `Edition` (collection) referral fee is assigned to the `mint` referrer, instead of `referrers[edition_]`.

## Impact

`Edition` (collection) referrers receive no fees.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _splitProtocolFee(
    IEdition edition_,
    address asset_,
    uint256 amount_,
    address payer_,
    address referrer_
) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
    ...
    _route(
        Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
        Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}), //@audit should be referrers[edition_]
        payer_
    );
}
```

## Recommendation

Replace `referrer_` with `referrers[edition_]`.
```solidity
function _splitProtocolFee(
    IEdition edition_,
    address asset_,
    uint256 amount_,
    address payer_,
    address referrer_
) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
    ...
    _route(
        Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
        Target({target: referrers[edition_], chainId: block.chainid}), //@audit changed to referrers[edition_]
        payer_
    );
}
```
