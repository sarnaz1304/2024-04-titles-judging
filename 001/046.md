# Missing access control in `FeeManager::collectMintFee` could result in misdirection of protocol fees

## Summary

`FeeManager::collectMintFee` lacks access control for the caller and a proper validation for the `referrer_` parameter, allowing any caller to potentially redirect fees to an arbitrary address. This can be exploited to misdirect fees and/or steal tokens if the protocol has prior approval to move ERC20 tokens on behalf of their users, as well as redirect any leftover ETH in the `FeeManager`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`FeeManager::collectMintFee` is designed to collect fees when minting tokens. It calculates and distributes fees based on a passed `Strategy` struct. The vulnerability arises because the function does not validate the caller and furthermore it does not restrict who can be specified as the `referrer_`. This oversight allows any user to specify their own address or another arbitrary address as the referrer, potentially redirecting fees to unauthorized parties.

## Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to financial losses for legitimate token holders and disrupt the intended fee distribution logic of the protocol. It can particularly affect scenarios where ERC20 tokens are used, and the protocol has been granted approval to manage these tokens on behalf of users, however, any excess ETH in the contract could also get targeted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce access controls that restrict the calling of `FeeManager::collectMintFee` to trusted contracts within the TITLES protocol ecosystem, such as `IEdition` that collects fees for its mints, by giving them a specific role that authorizes them to perform fee collection(s), e.g. `FEE_COLLECTOR_ROLE`.

```diff
// Common.sol

+ // Fee Manager roles
+ uint256 constant FEE_COLLECTOR_ROLE = 1 << 31;
```

```diff
// FeeManager.sol
function createRoute(
    IEdition edition_,
    uint256 tokenId_,
    Target[] calldata attributions_,
    address referrer_
) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) returns (Target memory receiver) {
    // ... previous code

+   _grantRoles(address(edition_), FEE_COLLECTOR_ROLE);
    _feeReceivers[getRouteId(edition_, tokenId_)] = receiver;
    referrers[edition_] = referrer_;
}
```

```diff
// FeeManager.sol
function collectMintFee(
    IEdition edition_,
    uint256 tokenId_,
    uint256 amount_,
    address payer_,
    address referrer_
- ) external payable {
+ ) external payable onlyRoles(FEE_COLLECTOR_ROLE) {
    _collectMintFee(
        edition_, tokenId_, amount_, payer_, referrer_, getMintFee(edition_, tokenId_, amount_)
    );
}
```
