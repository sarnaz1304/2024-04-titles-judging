# Failure to control the size of msg.value can result non-payment fees FOR MINTINT being paid for money on the FeeManager contract rather than money attached to the transaction

## Summary
In all mint functions in the Edition.sol contract [called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L236-L238) 
```solidity
FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );
```
We can see that msg.value is attached to the call, but there is no validation on the size of the attached msg.value in either the mint functions or the collectMintFee function. The commission is simply distributed to the right addresses at the expense of the FeeManager contract and without validation it is assumed that the attached msg.value is sufficient.

An attacker can track when the FeeManager has enough funds (e.g. listen to a mempool to find the receipt of funds in the receive() function) Immediately afterwards send a transaction to which he will attach msg.value -> 0 (maybe zero, maybe a very small number, there is no validation anyway) and then he has not paid anything from mintFee at his expense.

## Vulnerability Detail
I have described the process of paying commissions in minutes in detail in the other two issues
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles-BengalCatBalu/issues/3 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles-BengalCatBalu/issues/4  You can see from the same issues that no validation is performed in collectMintFee.

Here I would like to show that none of the mint functions also perform validation on the size of msg.value

## Impact
Lack of validation in this case breaks the logic of the protocol and leads to loss of FeeManager funds
Score: High
