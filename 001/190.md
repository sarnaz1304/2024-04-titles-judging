# `Edition::_refundExcess` doesn't refund to the buyers.

## Summary

`Edition::_refundExcess` doesn't refund to the buyers because there are no remaining funds in `Edition.sol`.

## Vulnerability Detail

At `L236` of `Edition::mint`, it calls `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee()` and sends the `FEE_MANAGER` all ether paid by the `msg.sender`. As a result, there are no remaining funds in the edition contract, and `_refundExcess()` at `L241` sends no money back to the `msg.sender`.

```solidity
    function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
236     FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
241     _refundExcess();
    }
```

This problem also occurs in `Edition::mintWithComment` and `Edition::mintBatch`.

## Impact

Buyers never receive remaining funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The refunding mechanism should be implemented in `FeeManager.sol`, not in `Edition.sol`.
