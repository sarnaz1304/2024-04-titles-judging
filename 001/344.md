# `TitlesCore.sol` implements logic wrongly by givin the ownership of the edition to the `TitlesCore.sol` contract

## Summary
As the document states, the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` has the ownership of the edition and can adjust critical information of it. While `EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE` can perform limited action.

"
EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE (Restricted) => On an Edition, this role can:
1. Publish a new work with any desired configuration (publish).
   - This is the only way to create new works after the Edition is created.
 2. Mint promotional copies of any work (promoMint). 
   - There are no limitations on this action aside from the work's supply cap and minting period. 
3. Set the Edition's ERC2981 royalty receiver (setRoyaltyTarget).
   - This is the only way to change the royalty receiver for the Edition.
4. Grant or revoke any role to/from any address (grantRole, revokeRole).

EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE (Restricted) => On TitlesCore, this role can:
1. Publish a new work under any Edition for which they have been granted the role (i.e. edition.hasAnyRole(msg.sender, EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE) is true) (publish).
   - After auth, the request is passed to the Edition contract for further handling.
"

## Vulnerability Detail
`Edition.sol::initialize" function undermines the Edition's owner power. All the administrative power is passed to `TitlesCore.sol` when the function grants the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` to `TitlesCore.sol`.

## Impact
Edition owners lose ownership of their collection when it's created, being limited to only publishing new work without performing any change that otherwise it would be allowed to.
