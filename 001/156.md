# Referrers won't get any fees on batch mints

## Summary
In TITLES a mint referrer is someone who refers a mint, and gets a cut of the mint fee for that mint. In every mint function except for the two `mintBatch()` functions the referrer is rewarded.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function mintBatch(address[] calldata receivers_, uint256 tokenId_, uint256 amount_, bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
        );
```
In this function the `collectMintFee()` function is called with `address(0)` as an input for the referrer argument. This means that the referrer will get no fees from that.

## Impact
Imagine a scenario where someone refers 5 people to mint a certain work. 
There are two options:
1.The `mint()` function is called 5 times, once for each of the 5 people.
2.They use the `mintBatch()` function

The difference between these two is that from the second one the referrer will get no referrer fees

I think that referrers should get fees from all of the mint functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow referrers to get fees from the `mintBatch()` functions. For the other `mintBatch()` function that I didn't mention perhaps an array of referrers can be added as input that correspond to the works that are minted.
