# `mintBatch()` for 2+ iterations will use stored funds or will revert

## Summary

The use of `msg.value` in a loop is a mispattern as its value remains fixed during the whole function call. So, for n-iteration of the loop: `n * msg.value` is sent. Given that the `msg.sender` didn't send that much: either the contract has enough stored funds to be used for free, or the call will revert

## Vulnerability Detail

This is a common issue. Several blog posts explain it ([1](https://trustchain.medium.com/ethereum-msg-value-reuse-vulnerability-5afd0aa2bcef), [2](https://www.rareskills.io/post/smart-contract-security#viewer-et29d))

```solidity
File: Edition.sol
277:     function mintBatch(
278:         address to_,
279:         uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
280:         uint256[] calldata amounts_,
281:         bytes calldata data_
282:     ) external payable {
283:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
284:             Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];
285: 
286:             // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
287:             FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
288:                 this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
289:             );
```

## Impact

Use of stored funds for free (theft of stored funds)

Or DOS

`mintBatch` doesn't work for arrays of size > 1

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Assuming the excess `msg.value` funds aren't stuck in excess in `FEE_MANAGER`, consider keeping track of `address(this).balance` between calls on the `Edition` contract to only forward what's left.
Additionally, consider checking that the final balance isn't subtracted by less than the initial `msg.value`, or it means that the user could use stored funds for free
