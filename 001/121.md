# Collection referrers percentage fee are also mistakenly sent to the mint referrer

## Summary
Collection referrer percentage fee are also mistakenly sent to the mint referrer making the mint referrer earn more than it should earn and leaving the Collection referrer with nothing 

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol states that 
 Protocol Share
  If a referred mint, mint referrer gets 50% of the protocol share
  If a referred collection, collection referrer gets 25% of the protcol share

But this was flawed as both the mint referrer and collection referrer  fees are sent to the mint referrer during the split denying collectionReferrer of  it's own shares.
```solidity
 function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
        // The creation and mint referrers earn 25% and 50% of the protocol's share respectively, if applicable
        uint256 mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount_, referrer_);
        uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]);
        referrerShare = mintReferrerShare + collectionReferrerShare;

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: amount_ - referrerShare}),
            Target({target: protocolFeeReceiver, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
        
       //this was meant to  be sent to  collectionReferrer address
        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
    }
```
## Impact
Breaking of protocol  functionality
loss of fee of the collection Referrer

## Code Snippet



```solidity
 function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
        // The creation and mint referrers earn 25% and 50% of the protocol's share respectively, if applicable
        uint256 mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount_, referrer_);
        uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]);
        referrerShare = mintReferrerShare + collectionReferrerShare;

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: amount_ - referrerShare}),
            Target({target: protocolFeeReceiver, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
        
       //this was meant to  be sent to  collectionReferrer address
        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
    }
