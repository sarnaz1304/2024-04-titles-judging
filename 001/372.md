# Reuse of `msg.value` in `Edition::mintBatch` for loop.

## Summary

Reuse of `msg.value` in `Edition::mintBatch` for loop.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Edition::mintBatch` function, reuses the `msg.value`, inside the for loop, when minting multiple tokens for a single user, and the amount of tokens to be minted is not taken into consideration.

## Impact

Attackers can mint multiple tokens for the price of one.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Don't use `msg.value` directly but store its value outside the for loop, and deduct the price every time `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee` is called.
