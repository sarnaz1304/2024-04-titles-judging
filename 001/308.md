# `mintBatch` will revert in almost all cases

## Summary

The `mintBatch` function intends to 'Mint multiple tokens for the given works'. The issue is that if there is more than one element in the `tokenIds_` array the function will revert due to a lack of funds to pay for the mint fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `mintBatch` all `tokenIds` provided by the caller are looped through, collecting the mint fee for each work. The problem is that all of the ETH provided by the caller in `msg.value` will be sent to the `FEE_MANAGER` in the first iteration of the loop.
As we can see in the `mintBatch` for loop:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
          Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

          // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
          FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
              this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
          );

          _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
          _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
      }
```

`FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}` is called for every `tokenId` with the same `msg.value`. Therefore, after the first iteration all of the `msg.value` will be sent to the `FEE_MANAGER`. In order for the rest of the iterations to be successful it would be required for their mint fees to be paid by the Edition's contract balance, which is highly likely to be insufficient (0 in most cases).

## Impact

The `mintBatch` function fails in almost all cases.

## Recommendation

Do not provide `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee` with the entire `msg.value`, but a part of it, enough to cover the expected fees.
