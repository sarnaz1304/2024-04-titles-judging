# Editions::mintBatch function will always revert

## Summary

`Editions::mintBatch` function used to mint more than 1 tokens to a single receiver will always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

This is the `Editions::mintBatch` function:

```javascript
    function mintBatch(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
@>          FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
            );

            _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
            _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
        }

        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```

As we can see, the function is sending the whole `msg.value` to the `FeeManager.sol` contract inside a `for loop`. This means, if the `tokenIds_` array has a `length > 1`, then the function will revert because it has already sent the whole `msg.value` and at the 2nd loop there are no more funds to send.

## Impact

The `mintBatch` function is unusable as it will always revert if a user wants to mint more than 1 tokens, which is the whole purpose of this function. Otherwise, the user would just use the `mint` function.

## Proof of Code

Paste the following code in `Edition.t.sol` file:

```javascript
    uint256[] tokenIds = [1, 1, 1];
    uint256[] amounts = [1, 1, 1];

    function test_mint_batch_doesnt_work() public {
        vm.expectRevert();
        edition.mintBatch{value: 10 ether}(address(1), tokenIds, amounts, new bytes(0));
    }
```

Running the test with `forge test --mt test_mint_batch_doesnt_work -vvvvv` we can see that it passes (so it reverts as expected) and it also reverts with `OutOfFunds` error.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

My recommendation is to calculate the necessary fee in each loop and only transfer the fee for each mint:

```diff
    function mintBatch(address to_, uint256[] calldata tokenIds_, uint256[] calldata amounts_, bytes calldata data_) external payable {
+       uint256 fee;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

+          fee = mintFee(tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i]);
+          FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: fee}(
-          FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
            );

            _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
            _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
        }

        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
