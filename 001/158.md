# Collection referrers will get no fees because of incorrect reward distribution

## Summary
There are two types of referrers that can exist within the protocol - a mint referrer and a collection referrer. They should both get fees if they have done refers but due to an error in the fees distribution the collection referrers will get nothing.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is what one of the comments states:
```solidity
//   - If a referred mint, mint referrer gets 50% of the protocol share
//   - If a referred collection, collection referrer gets 25% of the protcol share
//   - Protocol fee receiver gets the remainder of the protocol share
```
The function `_splitProtocolFee()` is used to calculate these three portions and route (transfer) them to the appropriate addresses.

Here we calculate what each referrer should get:
```solidity
uint256 mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount_, referrer_);
uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]);
```
As we can see from the second argument for each function the mint and collection referrers can be different addresses (this was also confirmed by a dev).

However during the fees distribution the 25% that the collection referrer is supposed to get actually goes to the mint refferer:
```solidity
_route(
  Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
  Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),  //target is mint referrer
  payer_
);

_route(
  Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
  Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),  //target is again mint referrer
  payer_
);
```

## Impact
Mint referrers will get the fees that collection referrers should get instead.

## Recommendation
```diff
_route(
  Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
  Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
  payer_
);

_route(
  Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
- Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
+ Target({target: referrers[edition_], chainId: block.chainid}),
  payer_
);
```
