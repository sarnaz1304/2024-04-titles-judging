# `Edition._refundExcess()` will not refund user funds

## Summary
[Edition._refundExcess()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L510-L517) must refund any amount not used up by the minting fees to the caller. It does not work because the whole `msg.value` is being forwarded to the `FeeManager` contract and there is nothing to be refunded.

## Vulnerability Detail
All functions that mint with fee - [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L241C1-L241C25), [mintWithComment()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L267) and [mintBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L277-L320) - send the whole `msg.value` to the `FeeManager` contract and then call `_refundExcess` assuming the excess will be in the current contract, but it will actually be in the `FeeManager` contract.

```solidity
    function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```

## Impact
Refunding functionality does not work, even though it should be supported. Users will lose their funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either add a refund mechanism to `FeeManager` as well or don't send the whole `msg.value`, but just a portion of it.
