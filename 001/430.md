# Invalid collection referrer leading to his loss

## Summary

The funds are sent to the wrong address and the collection referrer set by the creator of the work in `referrers[edition_]` never receives their fee. Instead the fee is sent to the mint referrer `referrer_`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the work is published, the `TitlesCore` contract calls the fee manager `createRoute` function that set's the referrer.

This referrer is meant to receive fee on each mint, distributed by the `_splitProtocolFee` function. However, when distributing the fees, the `collectionReferrerShare` is calculated for `referrers[edition_]` address, but is sent to `referrer_` (representing mint referrer):

## Impact

Collection referrer looses his fee.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `collectionReferrerShare` should be routed to `referrers[edition_]`:

```solidity
        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrers[edition_], chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
```
