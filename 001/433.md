# Incorrect realization of `Edition.sol::mintBatch`

## Summary
The function [`Edition.sol::mintBatch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L277-L277) is designed to mint several tokens in edition at once.

However, for each mint it collects a commission [separately](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L287-L287)
 attaching a full-sized msg.value to the msg.value call. The developers probably intended that the commission that is not used will be returned back, however this does not happen anywhere in the FeeManager logic. That is, already after the first call to collect the commission, there will be no funds left on Edition.sol's contract to attach to the next call (Edition.sol does not envisage that there will be funds lying on its balance)
Thus, the mintBatch function is infeasible. And its behaviour is clearly broken.

## Vulnerability Detail
Edition.sol is not designed to hold eth in its account. It has no receive function, and at the end of each transaction it has a call to
[_refundExcess](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L512-L512)
```solidity
function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
This way the contract will definitely not have enough funds (msg.value * tokenIds_.length) to complete the transaction.
## Impact
Broken basic protocol functionality.

Score: High
## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @notice Mint multiple tokens for the given works.
    /// @param to_ The address to mint the tokens to.
    /// @param tokenIds_ The IDs of the works to mint.
    /// @param amounts_ The amounts of each work to mint.
    /// @param data_ The data associated with the mint. Reserved for future use.
    function mintBatch(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
            FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
            );

            _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
            _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
        }

        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Fix the amount of eth attached to the collectMintFee call
