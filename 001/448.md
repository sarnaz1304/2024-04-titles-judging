# _refundExcess can fail allowing next minter to refund others users remaining tokens

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L228-242
 during minting, excess eth might be sent by a user, which is refunded using _refundExcess function. if this fails the excess eth will remain in the contract which is withdrawn by next users if in their case _refundExcess is succesfull
## Vulnerability Detail
 during minting, excess eth might be sent by a user, which is refunded using _refundExcess function. if this fails the excess eth will remain in the contract which is withdrawn by next users if in their case _refundExcess is succesfull
This vulnerability is possible because _refundExcess() doesn't check for each users excess tokens but withdraws all remaining tokens in the contract to users
## Impact
loss of user funds
## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
```solidity
 function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
}

```
## Tool used

Manual Review, vs code

## Recommendation
there should be a mapping to store excess tokens by users where in a user can only withdraw excess tokens from them only.
