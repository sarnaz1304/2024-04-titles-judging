# Edition.sol::mintBatch(multi-tokens to one receiver) will always revert because of wrong implementation to call FeeManager::collectMintFee

## Summary
`Edition.sol::mintBatch`(multi-tokens to one receiver) will always revert because of wrong implementation to call `FeeManager::collectMintFee`.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user calls the payable `Edition.sol::mintBatch` function with the needed ETH amounts (let's say it's `amountX`) as fee.
Then Edition contract's balance becomes amountX.
and then The `Edition.sol::mintBatch` function calls `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee` with `msg.value` inside of for-loop. here msg.value = amountX, so after this call for first tokenId, contract's balance would be amountX - msg.value = 0.
For second loop for 2nd tokenId, collectMintFee() function calling would be revert because of (msg.value > Edition's balance).
 

## Impact
As result, this mintBatch function will always revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value} with FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: address(this).balance} and then
in feemanger::collectMintFee() function, add code parts to refund left balance back to Edition contract.
