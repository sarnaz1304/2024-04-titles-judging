# Creating an edition not through `TitlesCore` can avoid paying the creation fee.

## Summary

If someone creates a new edition through `TitlesCore`, they have to create the first `tokenId` and pay the creation fee. However, they can create a new edition manually without making any `tokenId` to avoid paying the creation fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is a contract that allows creating new editions.

```solidity
    contract EditionMaker {
        function createEdition(address creator, Metadata metadata)
            external
            returns (Edition edition)
        {
            edition = Edition(titlesCore.editionImplementation.clone());

            edition.initialize(
                feeManager, graph, creator, address(titlesCore), metadata
            );
        }
    }
```

(Where `titlesCore`, `feeManager` and `graph` are those of the protocol.)

If Bob creates a new edition through this contract, there is no requirement to generate the first `tokenId`, so he can avoid paying the creation fee. Even the new edition created outside of `TitlesCore.sol` has no functional differences from those generated through `TitlesCore.sol`.

However, at `L87` of `TitlesCore::createEdition`, the publication of the first `tokenId` necessitates the payment of the creation fee.

```solidity
    function createEdition(bytes calldata payload_, address referrer_)
        external
        payable
        returns (Edition edition)
    {
        EditionPayload memory payload = abi.decode(payload_.cdDecompress(), (EditionPayload));

        edition = Edition(editionImplementation.clone());

        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        edition.initialize(
            feeManager, graph, payload.work.creator.target, address(this), payload.metadata
        );

        // wake-disable-next-line unchecked-return-value
87      _publish(edition, payload.work, referrer_);

        emit EditionCreated(
            address(edition),
            payload.work.creator.target,
            payload.work.maxSupply,
            payload.work.strategy,
            abi.encode(payload.metadata)
        );
    }
```

## Impact

Anyone can create a new edition without paying the creation fee.

## Recommendation

In `TitlesCore.sol`, there should be a state variable that keeps track of all valid editions created through `TitlesCore.sol`.
