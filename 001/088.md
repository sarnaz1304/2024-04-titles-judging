# `collectionReferrerShare` is routed to the wrong referrer in `FeeManager.sol`

## Summary
The wrong collection referrer address is used in `FeeManager.sol::_splitProtocolFee()`, which causes the collection referrer's share of the fees to be routed to the mint referrer. Due to this, the collection referrer receives no fees on mints and loses their claim.
## Vulnerability Detail
When minting an NFT through `Edition.sol`, a fee is collected through the `FeeManager.sol` contract using the  `collectMintFee()` function. This calls the `_collectMintFee()` function, which calls the `_splitProtocolFee` function to split the protocol's fee share between the collection referrer, the mint referrer, and the protocol fee receiver. However, the address used in the `_route()` function call to route the `collectionReferrerShare` is the mint referrer's address and not the collection referrer's address.

```solidity
    function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
  @>    address referrer_  // this is the mint refererr's address
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
        // The creation and mint referrers earn 25% and 50% of the protocol's share respectively, if applicable
        uint256 mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount_, referrer_);
        uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]);
        referrerShare = mintReferrerShare + collectionReferrerShare;

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: amount_ - referrerShare}),
            Target({target: protocolFeeReceiver, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
      @>    Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}), // `collectionReferrerShare` should be routed to referrers[edition_]
            payer_
        );
    }
 ```
