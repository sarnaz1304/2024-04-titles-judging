# Non-functional ether refund in Edition::mint()

## Summary
In Edition::mint(), the excess ether is designed to  refund to user. Users will be refunded 0 no matter how much ether user pays for the mint.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Edition::mint(), users need to pay some mint fees to get some token. If ether amount user send is larger than minting fee, the left ether is expected to user.
```c
    function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        ...
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );
        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
    function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
The vulnerability is that all ether are sent to FEE_MANAGER. Ether left in Edition contract is zero. So there will be nothing refunded to the user no matter how much he pay for the mint().

### Poc
```c
    function test_mint_refund() public {
        address alice = makeAddr("Alice");
        vm.deal(alice, 1 ether);
        console.log(address(alice).balance);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        edition.mint{value: 1 ether}(address(1), 1, 1, address(0), new bytes(0));
        console.log(address(alice).balance);
    }  

```
And the output log is as below:
```c
Ran 1 test for test/editions/Edition.t.sol:EditionTest
[PASS] test_mint_refund() (gas: 179177)
Logs:
  1000000000000000000
  0
```
This proves that there is nothing refunded to the user.

## Impact
The left ether cannot be refunded to the user.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the needed mint fee and send the needed mint fee to FEE_MANAGER. Left ether will be left in Edition Contract, then refund to the user.
