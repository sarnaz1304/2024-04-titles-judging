# The full `msg.value` Ether amount is sent to the `feeManager` without refund even when fee amount is zero

## Summary

When calling `TitlesCore.createEdition`, there's a `collectCreationFee()` function being called on `feeManager`.

Whether the `feeAmount` there is zero or a certain amount: any `msg.value` from the user will always be fully sent to the `feeManager` without any refunds.

## Vulnerability Detail

On `TitlesCore.createEdition`, we reach the following line: [TitlesCore.sol#L138](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol#L138)
```solidity
File: TitlesCore.sol
138:         feeManager.collectCreationFee{value: msg.value}(edition_, tokenId, msg.sender);
```

The implementation of `collectCreationFee` actually receives the funds on the `FeeManager` contract but doesn't give anything back in the event of an amount sent while fee is 0:

- [FeeManager.sol#L166-L171](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L166-L171)

```solidity
File: FeeManager.sol
166:     function collectCreationFee(IEdition edition_, uint256 tokenId_, address feePayer_)
167:         external
168:         payable
169:     {
170:         Fee memory fee = getCreationFee();
171:         if (fee.amount == 0) return; 
```

Also, in the event of an excess sent, the exact `fee.amount` is forwarded but the excess stays stuck in the `FeeManager` contract:

- [FeeManager.sol#L461-L467](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L461-L467)
```solidity
File: FeeManager.sol
461:     function _transfer(address asset_, uint256 amount_, address from_, address to_) internal {
462:         if (asset_ == ETH_ADDRESS) {
463:             to_.safeTransferETH(amount_);
464:         } else {
465:             asset_.safeTransferFrom(from_, to_, amount_);
466:         }
467:     }
```

Nowhere in the call flow is there an automatic refund mechanism for the user here.

While it could be argued that the admin can call `withdraw()` for each user, this is still not a viable solution, whereas the solution is simple to implement

## Impact

Funds are stuck, very often.

Case by case withdraw can be made by the admin, but the mistake can easily be avoided with a code fix.

## Recommendation

Implement a function refunding the excess
