# Editions's mintBatch() function does not pay enough fee

## Summary

The function `Edition.mintBatch()` used to mint a single tokenId and amount to a list of recipient does not pay out the correct fee amounts.

It pays a fee corresponding to the mint of `amount` tokens with the corresponding strategy `strategy[tokenId]` while it should pay fees for `amount * receivers_.length`

## Vulnerability Detail

The function pays a single fee corresponding to a mint of `amount` tokens and loops to produce `amount * receivers_.length` tokens:

```solidity
    /// @notice Mint a token to a set of receivers for the given work.
    /// @param receivers_ The addresses to mint the tokens to.
    /// @param tokenId_ The ID of the work to mint.
    /// @param amount_ The amount of tokens to mint.
    /// @param data_ The data associated with the mint. Reserved for future use.
    function mintBatch(
        address[] calldata receivers_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
        );  // @audit pays fee incorrectly, should pay amount * receivers_.length

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        }

        _refundExcess();
    }
```

## Impact

Not enough fees are being paid for the minting of the token resulting in a loss of funds for the fee recipients (protocol, edition referrer, work creator, and work attributions).

Anyone that wants to mint 100 tokens for a collection can use `mintBatch()` with a list containing 100 times their address and an amount of 1 to only pay out the fee for a single token mint.

## Recommendation

Use `amount * receivers_.length` instead of `amount` in the call to `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee()`
