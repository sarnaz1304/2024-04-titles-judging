# mint referrer can get mint fee which belongs to collection referrer

## Summary
mint referrer can get mint fee which belongs to collection referrer.
## Vulnerability Detail
> There are two types or referrers in this ecosystem. The first is a collection referrer, who refers the creation of a new Edition, and gets a cut of all mint fees for that Edition. The second is a mint referrer, who refers a mint, and gets a cut of the mint fee for that mint.

The distribution of mint fee is incorrect :
```solidity
uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]);
······
        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
```
mint referrer can get mint fee which belongs to collection referrer.
## Impact
The collection referrer will not get his mint fee.
