# _refundExcess function won't refund users while minting a token for a given work.

## Summary
While minting a new token, if user sends extra ETH, then it is expected that user will get their refund , which would be done by the `_refundExcess` function.
But it won't be the case and they won't get refund because of wrong implementation of `refundExcess` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
While minting as you can see: 

```javascript
/// @notice Mint a new token for the given work.
    /// @param to_ The address to mint the token to.
    /// @param tokenId_ The ID of the work to mint.
    /// @param amount_ The amount of tokens to mint.
    /// @param referrer_ The address of the referrer.
    /// @param data_ The data associated with the mint. Reserved for future use.
    function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```

User pays ETH, which is then being used for calling `collectMintFee` function in `FEE_MANAGER` contract, which handles the mint fee payment & then token is being issued and after that `_refundExcess` is being called, which is expected to handle the refund process.

The issue is :-
`FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );`

while calling this function with sending the value, the user's sent ETH would be then transferred to the FEE_MANAGER contract.
And then after processing the mint fee payment, the remaining value of ETH would be in FEE_MANAGER contract only.

But if we see `_refundExcess` implementation :-

```javascript
/// @notice Refund any excess ETH sent to the contract.
    /// @dev This function is called after minting tokens to refund any ETH left in the contract after all fees have been collected.
    
    // @SuS msg.value is not stored here , it is stored in FeeManager.
    function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```

It is expecting that the ETH will be in the Edition.sol contract only, and hence while checking it is checked whether `address(this).balance > 0`, if yes then safeTransferETH to the msg.sender

But since the ETH would be forwarded in FEE_MANAGER contract while calling `collectMintFee` function with `{ value : msg.value }`, balance of Edition contract will always be zero , and hence would not process the refunding.

Hence the implementation is wrong. 
## Impact
Users will not get refund as being expected by protocol, because of wrong implementation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of address(this).balance , while checking, the balance of FEE_MANAGER should be checked, and accordingly from FEE_MANAGER safeTransferETH  should be done.

```diff
function _refundExcess() internal {
-        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) 
+       if (msg.value > 0 && address(FEE_MANAGER).balance > 0) 
      {
-            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
+           msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(FEE_MANAGER).balance);
        }
    }
```
