# Edition.sol doesn't actually refunt excess ETH

## Summary
`Edition.sol` doesn't actually refunt excess ETH.
## Vulnerability Detail
When minting tokens, all of the ETH gets sent to the `FeeManager` contract, which would leave the `Edition.sol` contract empty to begin with. So any excess ETH would actually get stuck in the `FeeManager` contract. 
## Impact
The user will not recieve his excess ETH back.
## Code Snippet

```Solidity
function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```

```Solidity
function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Think of a way to return the excess ETH from `FeeManager.sol`.
