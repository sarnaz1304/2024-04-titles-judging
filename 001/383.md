# The reentrancy attack is possible while collecting fees in the `FeeManager` contract

## Summary

The [FeeManager.collectMintFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L202) function transfers the `Eth` to fee receivers, but it doesn't check reentrancy.
 As a result, the reentrancy attack is possible for `collectMintFee` function
 An attacker can receive more fees as long as there is enough `Eth` balance in `FeeManager` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `FeeManager.collectMintFee()` function calls `_route()` function.

```Solodity
File: wallflower-contract-v2\src\fees\FeeManager.sol
448:     function _route(Fee memory fee_, Target memory feeReceiver_, address feePayer_) internal {
449:         // Cross-chain fee routing is not supported yet
450:         if (block.chainid != feeReceiver_.chainId) revert NotRoutable();
451:         if (fee_.amount == 0) return;
452: 
453:         _transfer(fee_.asset, fee_.amount, feePayer_, feeReceiver_.target);
454:     }
```

The `_route()` function calls `_transfer()` function from L463 below.

```Solodity
File: wallflower-contract-v2\src\fees\FeeManager.sol
461:     function _transfer(address asset_, uint256 amount_, address from_, address to_) internal {
462:         if (asset_ == ETH_ADDRESS) {
463:             to_.safeTransferETH(amount_);
464:         } else {
465:             asset_.safeTransferFrom(from_, to_, amount_);
466:         }
467:     }
```

Assuming the fee receiver is a contract that calls the `collectMintFee()` function through the fallback function, the attacker can receive more fees as long as there is enough `Eth` balance in the `FeeManager` contract.

## Impact

The attacker can receive more fees by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability, as long as there is sufficient Ether balance in the `FeeManager` contract.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add reentrancy checking code for `collectMintFee()` and `collectCreationFee()` functions in `FeeManager` contract.
