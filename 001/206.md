# `Edition.sol::mintBatch()` will always revert for `tokenIds_.length` greater than 1

## Summary
The [`mintBatch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L277) function is used to mint multiple tokens in one transaction. However, doing so will cause the function to revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintBatch()` loops through the `tokenIds_` array and calls the `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee()` function to collect the fee for each mint :
```solidity
    function mintBatch(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];


            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
            FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
            );


            _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
            _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
        }


        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
This logic is incorrect as in the first iteration of the loop, `msg.value` amount of wei is sent to the `FEE_MANAGER` contract. Subsequently, during the `collectMintFee()` function call, the `FEE_MANAGER` contract spends only the mint fee amount and keeps the rest of `msg.value` in the contract. Because of this, during the next iteration of the loop, the `Edition.sol` contract does not have enough balance to call the `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee()` with the same `msg.value` amount as in the first iteration. This will cause the transaction to revert.

Note that the value of `msg.value` remains constant in a single function call and the `Edition.sol` contract does not hold any balance before the `mintBatch()` function is called.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the following changes in the function :
```diff
-            FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
-                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
+            uint256 mintFee_ = FEE_MANAGER.getMintFee(work.strategy, amounts_[i]).amount;
+            FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: mintFee_}(
+                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy  
             );
```
