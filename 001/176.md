# Incorrect Fee Distribution in `FeeManager.sol` Contract Affects Referrer Rewards

## Summary
The [`_splitProtocolFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L412-L441) function in the `FeeManager.sol` contract incorrectly distributes the collection referrer's share of the protocol fee to the mint referrer instead of the actual collection referrer. This bug affects the fair distribution of referrer shares and can lead to incorrect accounting and lack of incentive for collection referrers.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`_splitProtocolFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L412-L441) function is responsible for splitting the protocol fee among the protocol fee receiver, mint referrer, and collection referrer. However, there is an issue in the way the collection referrer's share is being distributed.

In the current implementation, the collection referrer's share [(`collectionReferrerShare`)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L437) is being sent to the `referrer_` address, which represents the mint referrer. This means that the mint referrer is receiving both their own share (`mintReferrerShare`) and the collection referrer's share, effectively doubling their intended share. Meanwhile, the actual collection referrer, whose address should be `referrers[edition_]`, is not receiving any share at all.

Here's the affected code snippet:

```solidity
function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
    
    //..........other logics...

   _route(
       Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
       Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
       payer_
   );

   _route(
       Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
       Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}), //@audit-issue - here should be target: referrers[edition_] instead of just referrer_
       payer_
   );
```
As shown above, both the `mintReferrerShare` and `collectionReferrerShare` are being sent to the `referrer_` address, which is incorrect for the collection referrer's share.
This bug leads to an unfair distribution of rewards, as the mint referrer receives more than their fair share, while the collection referrer receives nothing. It can also result in incorrect accounting and reporting of referrer shares, causing discrepancies in financial records.

## Impact
The incorrect distribution of the collection referrer's share has several impacts:

- The collection referrer is deprived of their rightful share of the protocol fee, leading to an unfair distribution of rewards.
- The mint referrer receives an additional share that they should not be entitled to, resulting in an overly rewarded scenario.
- The bug can disincentivize collection referrers from promoting or referring to the collection, as they do not receive their expected share of the fees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the code in the [`_splitProtocolFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L412-L441) function should be updated to correctly send the collection referrer's share to their address instead of the mint referrer.
Here's the recommended code change:
```diff
function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
    
    //..........other logics...
    
   _route(
       Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
       Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
       payer_
   );

   _route(
-        Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
-        Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
+       Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
+       Target({target: referrers[edition_], chainId: block.chainid}),
       payer_
   );
```
