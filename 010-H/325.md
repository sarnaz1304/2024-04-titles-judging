# `_refundExcess` in `Edition` is not working as intended

High

## Summary
`_refundExcess` function in Edition is responsible for returning the unused leftover of msg.value, but is used in function which send all of msg.value in `feeManager` contract leaving 0 in `Edition` contract;

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```

```solidity
function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
Code above shows how `mint` function in `Edition` contract works. Mistake is coming from that in `mint` functions in `Edition`contract calls `FEE_MANAGER` with all the value of `msg.value` leaving `0` in `Edition` contract leaving `_refundExcess` 
with `address(this).balance = 0;`

Call FEE_MANAGER with the msg.value it only needs;
