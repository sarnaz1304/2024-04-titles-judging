# mintBatch function will revert because it tries to pay excess fees than intended which won't be present in the contract.

## Summary
mintBatch function will revert because it tries to pay excess fees than intended which won't be present in the contract which will prevent a use from using that function and this revert is permanent.
## Vulnerability Detail
Following is mintBatch function 
```solidity
function mintBatch(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
            FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
            );

            _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
            _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
        }

        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
Main issue lies in the following line 
 FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
                this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
            );
the above line is executed in for loop so which means it forwards eth amount = msg.value to the fee manager contract each time for loop is executed thus essentially it tries to send total msg.value*tokenIds.length amount of eth to the fee manager which is not possible because only msg.value amount of eth was send by the user for executing this function. So the for loop will fail at the Second iteration making to impossible to use this function.

## Impact
This breaks the functionality of this function making it useless unless tokenIds = 1.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Exact mitigation of for this is difficult because we can't just divide msg.value  by number of token ids because fees collected for each token id can differ as each token id can have different mint fee and other parameters.
