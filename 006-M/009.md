# Signature malleability allows replay attacks in Titlesgraph when acknowledgeEdge and unacknowledgeEdge

## Summary
Signature malleability allows replay attacks in smart contract functions using ECDSA signatures for authorization.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract relies on ECDSA signatures for the validation of critical operations in functions like `acknowledgeEdge` and `unacknowledgeEdge`. Due to the malleability of ECDSA signatures, it is possible to alter a valid signature in such a way that it remains valid but results in a different hash when checked using _isUsed[keccak256(signature)]. This makes it possible to replay the signature for unauthorized operations by https://medium.com/draftkings-engineering/signature-malleability-7a804429b14a . 



## Impact
Attackers can repeatedly use manipulated signatures to authorize transactions that should only be possible once, potentially leading to unauthorized state changes or other malicious activities within the contract. For example, attackers can call `acknowledgeEdge` after    
`unacknowledgeEdge` if he had a valid signature before (if he call `acknowledgeEdge` before, he had a valid signature).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `nonce` field when calc `bytes32 digest = _hashTypedData(keccak256(abi.encode(ACK_TYPEHASH, edgeId, data)));` i.e. we may calc `bytes32 digest = _hashTypedData(keccak256(abi.encode(ACK_TYPEHASH, edgeId, data, nonce)));` If success, `nonce++`;
