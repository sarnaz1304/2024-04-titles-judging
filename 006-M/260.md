# Functions requiring signatures will fail for EIP712 signers

## Summary
The hashed `digest` for checking signature is not fully EIP-712 compliant which will lead to integration issues for EIP-712 signers.

## Vulnerability Detail

The TitleGraphs contract allow users to acknowledge/unacknowledge an edge using an ECDSA signature. The issue is that the signature is not EIP-712 compliant causing that EIP-712 compliant signers will not be able to acknowledge and unacknowledge edges as the function will revert.

```solidity
    modifier checkSignature(bytes32 edgeId, bytes calldata data, bytes calldata signature) {
        bytes32 digest = _hashTypedData(keccak256(abi.encode(ACK_TYPEHASH, edgeId, data))); //@note
        if (
            !edges[edgeId].to.creator.target.isValidSignatureNowCalldata(digest, signature)
                || _isUsed[keccak256(signature)]
        ) {
            revert Unauthorized();
        }
        _;
        _isUsed[keccak256(signature)] = true;
    }
```
Accroding to EIP-712, the data parameter which is being included as part of the signature, is a dynamic type, which the EIP explains that it should be [encoded](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-encodedata) as the hash of the contents; As it stands, the data parameter is being encoded as-is.

## Impact
The data being signed is not being encoded as per the EIP-712 specification, which will result in unexpected integration failures with EIP712-compliant signers that perform the encoding in the appropriate way resulting in them not being able to use the `acknowledgeEdge` and `unacknowledgeEdge` functions.

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation

Encode the dynamic data parameter as per the EIP-712 specification.

```solidity
    modifier checkSignature(bytes32 edgeId, bytes calldata data, bytes calldata signature) {
        bytes32 digest = _hashTypedData(keccak256(abi.encode(ACK_TYPEHASH, edgeId, keccak256(data))));
...
    }
```
