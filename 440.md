# Protocol won't work on zkSync

## Summary
Protocol won't work on zkSync because of libraries incompatible with zkSync EVM.

## Vulnerability Detail
Opcodes like `create` from LibClone Solady library that is called during clone call https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol#L79 or `create2` from Clone SplitFactory https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L144.
has different behaviour on zkSync chain -

## Impact
Addresses will be calculated in different way and protocol will be broken.

## Recommendation
Use compatible libraries that will work on zkSync instead.
