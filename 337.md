# Broken Role Checking Mechanism

## Summary

The current role checking feature is flawed because it verifies only the presence of a role for an address, without confirming if the address holds the correct role for the specific Edition/Work.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the README, the roles `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE`, `EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE`, and `EDITION_MINTER_ROLE` should be confined to their respective contexts.

The sponsor mentioned in the Discord channel:

> Edition owners and Work creators are trusted in the context of their own respective Editions/Works but not in the context of the broader ecosystem including other Editions/Works

However, the existing role checking system merely verifies that an address possesses a role, disregarding the specific Edition/Work to which this role applies. Consequently, an address with the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` can act on all Editions, and similarly for other roles.

```solidity
    /// @dev Marks a function as only callable by an account with `roles`.
    modifier onlyRoles(uint256 roles) virtual {
        _checkRoles(roles);
        _;
    }
```
```solidity
    /// @dev Throws if the sender does not have any of the `roles`.
    function _checkRoles(uint256 roles) internal view virtual {
        /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
        assembly {
            // Compute the role slot.
            mstore(0x0c, _ROLE_SLOT_SEED)
            mstore(0x00, caller())
            // Load the stored value, and if the `and` intersection
            // of the value and `roles` is zero, revert.
            if iszero(and(sload(keccak256(0x0c, 0x20)), roles)) {
                mstore(0x00, 0x82b42900) // `Unauthorized()`.
                revert(0x1c, 0x04)
            }
        }
    }
```

For instance, a malicious user with the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` or `EDITION_MINTER_ROLE` could exploit `Edition.promoMint()` to issue the entire collection of tokens from another Edition not owned by them.

## Impact

The flawed role system allows unauthorized users to act on other users' Editions and Works.

## Recommendation

Implement role checks using the OpenZeppelin Access Control library to ensure roles are contextually appropriate.
