# `EDITION_MINTER_ROLE` is not configurable as `grantRoles()` cannot be called in `Edition.sol`

## Summary
Quoting the QnA :
```md
EDITION_MINTER_ROLE (Restricted) =>
On an Edition, this role can:
1) Mint promotional copies of any work (promoMint). There are no limitations on this action aside from the work's supply cap and minting period.
```
However, this role cannot be assigned to any address.
## Vulnerability Detail
The [`grantRoles()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L423) function in `Edition.sol` can only be called by the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` role :
```solidity
    function grantRoles(address user_, uint256 roles_)
        public
        payable
        override
        onlyRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE)
    {
        _grantRoles(user_, roles_);
    }
```
 This role is assigned to the `TitlesCore.sol` contract when an `Edition.sol` contract is initialized. However, there is no function in `TitlesCore.sol` that calls the `grantRoles()` function of `Edition.sol`, making it impossible to invoke it to configure `EDITION_MINTER_ROLE`. 
## Impact
Only the `owner` of the `Edition.sol` contract can mint promo tokens.

## Recommendation
Make the following change to `grantRoles()` : 
```diff
-     onlyRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE)
+    onlyOwnerOrRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE)
```
