# DoS Ð² mintBatch and promoMintFunction

## Summary
The `Edition.sol::mintButch` and `Edition.sol::promoMint` functions mines nft to a large number of addresses. If this list includes the smart contract address of a malicious user, he may revert the entire transaction because the _mint function is subject to reentrancy.
Thus, all other users will not receive their nfts either.
## Vulnerability Detail
Edition uses the function [`Edition.sol::issue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L480-L480) to mint nft to the user's address, which in turn calls _mint in the contract {ERC1155} from "solady/tokens/ERC1155.sol"

This _mint function has [the following check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/lib/solady/src/tokens/ERC1155.sol#L508-L508) at the very end:
```solidity
if (_hasCode(to)) _checkOnERC1155Received(address(0), to, id, amount, data);
```
the _checkOnERC1155Received function passes control to the recipient address, if it is a malicious contract, it will simply reverse the entire transaction when it gets control.

## Impact
In order to carry out the attack, the malicious contract needs to get on the recipient list.

## Recommendation
It might be worth sending nft only to EOA addresses, or wrapping the call in try{}Catch{} so that failure in one call does not affect the others.
