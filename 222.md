# Inconsistent `protocolShare` calculation in `FeeManager::_collectMintFee()` that will likely incentivize creators to pick lower mint fees

## Summary

`protocolShare` calculation in `FeeManager::_collectMintFee()` can lead to more fees for the `creator` if the `mintFee` decreases, incentivizing smaller mint fees for the loss of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

`FeeManager::_collectMintFee()` calculates the `protocolShare` by doing:
```solidity
uint256 protocolFee = protocolFlatFee * amount_;
uint256 protocolShare;
if (fee_.amount == protocolFee) {
    protocolShare = protocolFee * protocolFeeshareBps / MAX_BPS;
} else {
    protocolShare = protocolFee;
}
```
Using the numbers hardcoded in the contract, 
`protocolFlatFee = 0.0006 ether`
`fee_.amount = amount * (mintFee + protocolFlatFee)`
`protocolFeeshareBps = 3333`
`creatorFee = fee_.amount - protocolShare`
Now, consider an amount of 1.

If `mintFee == 0`, 
protocol receives `protocolFee * protocolFeeshareBps / MAX_BPS; = protocolFlatFee * amount * protocolFeeshareBps / MAX_BPS = 0.0006 * 1 * 1 / 3 = 0.0002 ether`
creator receives `0.0006 - 0.0002 = 0.0004 ether` 

if `mintFee == 1`,
protocol receives `protocolFlatFee*amount = 0.0006`
creator receives `amount * (1 + 0.0006 ether) - 0.0006 ether = 1 * (1 + 0.0006 ether) - 0.0006 ether = 1`

Therefore, in order to receive the same amount of fees, the creator would have to charge a fee of `0.004` (`1 * (0.004 + 0.0006) - 0.006 = 0.004 ether`.

Taking into account price and demand, it should be much more profitable for the creator to pick the lowest price here (free mint), as the minter would pay only `0.0006 ether`, much less than `0.0010`, for the same fees for the creator.

## Impact

Loss of yield from the protocol as creators are incentivized to pick lower prices.

## Recommendation

The fees for the creator, in case `fee.amount > protocolFee`, should increase continuously in comparison to `fee.amount == protocolFee`, or the protocol risks losing yield due to mismatched incentives.
