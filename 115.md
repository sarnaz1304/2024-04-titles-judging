# users cannot mint NFTs for new published works

## Summary
users cannot mint NFTs for new published works
## Vulnerability Detail
When user use the `publish` function(he has the EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE) they create a new work, if someone wants to mint this kind of NFT, they would use the `mint`. -> in the mint function first it will transfer the fee by `collectMintFee` function, This is where it comes the problem, because when a new work is published there is not added a new  `_feeReceiver` for this tokenId.
And when is trying to get the getRouteId it would give the default value and it will always revert in _route function.

## Impact
Users cannot mint new NFTs

POC: 

function test_InvalidWorkTarget() public {
        address[] memory recipients = new address[](1);
        recipients[0] = address(1);

        // Only the owner, edition manager, or edition minter can promo mint,
        // and the caller has none of these roles by default

        // Give the caller the EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE
        edition.grantRoles(address(0xdeadbeef), 1 << 11);

        vm.prank(address(0xdeadbeef));
        // Call as our newly authorized manager
        edition.publish(
            address(0xdeadbeef), // creator
            10, // maxSupply
            0, // opensAt
            0, // closesAt
            new Node[](0), // attributions
            Strategy({
                asset: address(0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE),
                mintFee: 0.01 ether,
                revshareBps: 2500, // 25%
                royaltyBps: 250 // 2.5%
            }),
            Metadata({
                label: "Best Work Ever",
                uri: "ipfs.io/best-work-ever",
                data: new bytes(0)
            })
        );

        Target memory feeReceiver = feeManager.feeReceiver(edition, 2);
        emit LogFeeReceiver(feeReceiver.chainId, feeReceiver.target);

        vm.prank(address(0xdeadbeef));
        vm.deal(address(0xdeadbeef), 10 ether);

        edition.mint{value: 0.0106 ether}(
            address(0xdeadbeef),
            2,
            1,
            address(0),
            new bytes(0)
        );
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When publishing a new Work in a Edition
add in the _feeReceivers mapping of FeeManager a Traget receiver with the id of the new Work
