# Edges would never get acknowledged due to logic error

## Summary
When creator or entity executes `TitlesGraph.sol::acknowledgeEdge` the edge's acknowledged property is set to true in memory instead of storage. Due to this, when  `TitlesGraph.sol::acknowledgeEdge`'s execution ends, edge's acknowledged property is left back to false again

## Vulnerability Detail
Possible scenario:

1. User1 creates EdgeA to make WorkA refer to EditionA
2. User2(creator of EditionA) wants to acknowledge EdgeA and executes `TitlesGraph.sol::acknowledgeEdge`
3. `TitlesGraph.sol::acknowledgeEdge` calls `TitlesGraph.sol::_setAcknowledged`
```solidity
function _setAcknowledged(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bool acknowledged_)
        internal
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        if (!_edgeIds.contains(edgeId_)) revert NotFound();
        edge = edges[edgeId_];
        edge.acknowledged = acknowledged_;

        if (acknowledged_) {
            emit EdgeAcknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
        } else {
            emit EdgeUnacknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
        }
    }
```
4. During `TitlesGraph.sol::_setAcknowledged`'s execution, `EdgeA.acknowledged`'s  value is set to true

Note that `TitlesGraph.sol::_setAcknowledged` initialises edge in memory instead of storage
```solidity
function _setAcknowledged(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bool acknowledged_)
   ...
        returns (Edge memory edge)
   ...
```
5. After ending the execution, `EdgeA.acknowledged`'s  value is set back to false, because memory is deleted 

## Impact
All protocol Edges will always have their acknowledged property equal to false, no matter any `TitlesGraph.sol::acknowledgeEdge`'s execution

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify `TitlesGraph.sol::_setAcknowledged` as shown below:
```diff
function _setAcknowledged(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bool acknowledged_)
        internal
-       returns (Edge memory edge)
+       returns (Edge storage edge)
    {
        if (!_edgeIds.contains(edgeId_)) revert NotFound();
        edge = edges[edgeId_];
        edge.acknowledged = acknowledged_;

        if (acknowledged_) {
            emit EdgeAcknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
        } else {
            emit EdgeUnacknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
        }
    }
```
