# Attacker would frontrun user's transaction and steal user's excessive ETH

## Summary
Attacker would frontrun user's transaction like `mint()` , `mintWithComment()` , `mintBatch()` and steal user's excessive ETH
## Vulnerability Detail
- Attacker would see the above mentioned functions in mempool where user have passed excessive ETH .
- Then attacker frontrun user's transaction increasing the mintFee price using setFeeStrategy()
- And there is no check for the mintFee amount inside validateStrategy().
- So attacker would increase the mintFee to very high value causing loss of user's fund.

## Impact
- Loss of exessive ETH of user due to frontrunning.

## Recommendation
