# Inflexibility in `ADMIN_ROLE` Address Configuration in FeeManager Contract

## Summary

The `FeeManager` contract lacks the functionality to update the address associated with the `ADMIN_ROLE`, unlike other contracts in the system such as `TitlesCore` and `TitlesGraph`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `FeeManager` contract initializes the `ADMIN_ROLE` with a specific address and does not provide a mechanism to update or change this address, contrasting with other system contracts that allow such modifications. This inconsistency can responsiveness to changes in governance or operational needs.

## Impact

This is a medium severity issue as it restricts the system's ability to respond to changes in administration or to security incidents involving the keys or accounts associated with the `ADMIN_ROLE`. 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L113-L118

```solidity
    constructor(address admin_, address protocolFeeReceiver_, address splitFactory_) {
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
        _grantRoles(admin_, ADMIN_ROLE);
        protocolFeeReceiver = protocolFeeReceiver_;
        splitFactory = SplitFactoryV2(splitFactory_);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To enhance the flexibility and security of the `FeeManager` contract, implement a method to update the `ADMIN_ROLE` dynamically.
