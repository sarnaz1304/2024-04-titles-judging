# `FeeManager.sol::_splitProtocolFee` implements the wrong logic, always sending `collectionReferrer` percentage to `mintReferrer`

## Summary
The `FeeManager.sol::_splitProtocolFee` function is used to reward actors who help the protocol grow. However, the distribution of earnings is wrongly performed.

## Vulnerability Detail
`FeeManager.sol::_splitProtocolFee` receives the referrer address as a param.
1. Calculates the `mintReferrerShare` passing the `amount` & `referrer_` address to `FeeManager.sol::getMintReferrerShare`;
   - If the `referrer_` address is not an `address(0)`, will return the fee value.
3. Calculates the `mintReferrerShare` passing `amount` & `referrers[edition_]` address to `FeeManager.sol::getCollectionReferrerShare`;
   - If the `referrers[edition_]` address is not an `address(0)`, will return the fee value.

Until this point, things look ok. However, when the distribution starts, is `mintReferrerShare` the one who receives both amounts, as you can see here:

<summary>Target == referrer_ in both functions</summary>

```diff
        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
@>      Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
@>      Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
```

## Impact
Although the `collectionReferrerShare` did his part in helping the protocol grow, he will never receive his share. Every time a mint occurs, the `mintReferrerShare` will receive all the earnings.

    }
