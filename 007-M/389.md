# `Edition.transferWork` does not update fee routes

## Summary

[`Edition.transferWork`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L412-L420) does not update the work's fee route, keeps sending fee payments to initial creator.

## Vulnerability Detail


[`Edition.transferWork`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L412-L420) changes the work's creator, but doesn't update the fee route in `FeeManager`.

## Impact

Fee payments still go to the initial creator.
