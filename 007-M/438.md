# `Edition::transferWork()` does not change the fee receiver to the new `creator`

## Summary

`Edition::transferWork()` transfers the `creator` of a work to a new `to` but does not modify the route in the `FeeManager` to the new `creator`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Mint fees are payed to the `creator` of a work based on the stored `_feeReceivers` mapping, which is set only when the work is published in `TitlesCore::_publish()`.

In `Edition::transferWork()`, only `work.creator = to_;` is set, without changing the route in `FeeManager`.

Note that royalty information should likely also be updated.

## Impact

Loss of funds for the new `creator`.

## Recommendation

`FeeManager::createRoute()` is permissioned by the `admin` or `owner`, so it can not be called directly, but a way to call it from an entity should be added.
