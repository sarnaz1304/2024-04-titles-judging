# `Edition.transferWork()` does not update the creator info in `TitleGraph`'s Node, allowing old owner be able to change the acknowledged status in relevant edges

## Summary

The ﻿`Edition.transferWork()` function updates the ﻿`work.creator` information in the ﻿Edition contract to reflect the new owner, but it does not update the corresponding ﻿creator information for relevant edges in the ﻿`TitlesGraph` contract. Consequently, after a work is transferred to a new owner using ﻿`Edition.transferWork()`, the old owner can still acknowledge or unacknowledge  relevant edges, while the new owner cannot.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function transferWork(address to_, uint256 tokenId_) external {
        Work storage work = works[tokenId_];
        if (msg.sender != work.creator) revert Unauthorized();

        // Transfer the work to the new creator
        work.creator = to_;

        emit WorkTransferred(address(this), tokenId_, to_);
    }
```

When the ﻿`transferWork()` function in the `﻿Edition` contract transfers ownership of a work, the `﻿work.creator` is updated to the new owner. However, other owner-specific access controls should also be transferred to the new owner. In the ﻿`TitlesGraph`, the ﻿creator information of relevant edges for this work remains unchanged, allowing the old owner to still acknowledge or unacknowledge these edges, while the new owner cannot.

## Impact
After a work is transferred to a new owner by ﻿`Edition.transferWork()`, the old owner can still acknowledge or unacknowledge  relevant edges, while the new owner cannot.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In my opinion, I think it's better to just remove the `transferWork()` function in the `Edition` contract.
