# Whenever a new work is added to a existing edition it overrites the referrers[editon] value which denies the previous referrer from fees which he should recieve.

## Summary
Whenever a new work is added to a existing edition it overrites the referrers[editon] value which denies the previous referrer from fees which he should receive.
## Vulnerability Detail
Main function which is used to publish new edition or works is the internal _publish function 
```solidity
function _publish(Edition edition_, WorkPayload memory work_, address referrer_)
        internal
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        // Publish the new Work in the Edition
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        tokenId = edition_.publish(
            work_.creator.target,
            work_.maxSupply,
            work_.opensAt,
            work_.closesAt,
            work_.attributions,
            work_.strategy,
            work_.metadata
        );

        // Collect the creation fee
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        feeManager.collectCreationFee{value: msg.value}(edition_, tokenId, msg.sender);

        // Create the fee route for the new Work
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        Target memory feeReceiver = feeManager.createRoute(
            edition_, tokenId, _attributionTargets(work_.attributions), referrer_
        );

        // Set the royalty target for the new Work
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        edition_.setRoyaltyTarget(tokenId, feeReceiver.target);
    }
```
The following line of code sets the referrers for a particular edition whenever a new work is published
```solidity
Target memory feeReceiver = feeManager.createRoute(
            edition_, tokenId, _attributionTargets(work_.attributions), referrer_
        );
```
CreateRoute function is as follows
```solidity
function createRoute(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        Target[] calldata attributions_,
        address referrer_
    ) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) returns (Target memory receiver) {
        Target memory creator = edition_.node(tokenId_).creator;

        if (attributions_.length == 0) {
            // No attributions, pay the creator directly
            receiver = creator;
        } else {
            // Distribute the fee among the creator and attributions
            (address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory revshares) = _buildSharesAndTargets(
                creator, attributions_, edition_.feeStrategy(tokenId_).revshareBps
            );

            // Create the split. The protocol retains "ownership" to enable future use cases.
            receiver = Target({
                target: splitFactory.createSplit(
                    SplitV2Lib.Split({
                        recipients: targets,
                        allocations: revshares,
                        totalAllocation: 1e6,
                        distributionIncentive: 0
                    }),
                    address(this),
                    creator.target
                    ),
                chainId: creator.chainId
            });
        }

        _feeReceivers[getRouteId(edition_, tokenId_)] = receiver;
        referrers[edition_] = referrer_;
    }
```
As can be seen from the following line referrers[edition_] = referrer_ it always overrites the exisiting referrer to new referrer.
The issue here is whenever a new token is minted from the edition contract the user pays fees and some of that fees goes to the  referrers[edition_]  which is equal to the collectionReferrer share which can be seen from the following collectFee and splitprotocol fees in the fee manager contract

```solidity
function _collectMintFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_,
        Fee memory fee_
    ) internal {
        if (fee_.amount == 0) return;

        // For free mints:
        // - Protocol Share = 1/3 of flat fee
        // - Edition Share = 2/3 of flat fee
        //
        // For priced mints:
        // - Protocol Share = 100% of flat fee, shared as follows:
        // - Edition Share = 100% of creator-specified mint cost, 0% of flat fee
        //
        // In both cases, the protocol and edition shares may be split as follows:
        // - Protocol Share
        //   - If a referred mint, mint referrer gets 50% of the protocol share
        //   - If a referred collection, collection referrer gets 25% of the protcol share
        //   - Protocol fee receiver gets the remainder of the protocol share
        // - Edition Share
        //   - Attributions equally split 25% of the edition share, if applicable
        //   - Creator gets the remainder of the edition share

        uint256 protocolFee = protocolFlatFee * amount_;
        uint256 protocolShare;
        if (fee_.amount == protocolFee) {
            protocolShare = protocolFee * protocolFeeshareBps / MAX_BPS;
        } else {
            protocolShare = protocolFee;
        }

        _route(
            Fee({asset: fee_.asset, amount: fee_.amount - protocolShare}),
            _feeReceivers[getRouteId(edition_, tokenId_)],
            payer_
        );

        uint256 referrerShare =
            _splitProtocolFee(edition_, fee_.asset, protocolShare, payer_, referrer_);
        emit FeeCollected(address(edition_), tokenId_, fee_.asset, fee_.amount, referrerShare);
    }

    function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
        // The creation and mint referrers earn 25% and 50% of the protocol's share respectively, if applicable
        uint256 mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount_, referrer_);
   ==>     uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]);
        referrerShare = mintReferrerShare + collectionReferrerShare;

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: amount_ - referrerShare}),
            Target({target: protocolFeeReceiver, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
   ==>         Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
    }
```
So if a new work is published then the previous referrer won't receive any fee as he would be overriden.It is a issue becasue hadn't new work been published then the previous referrer would have received his share of mint fee but now the referrer gets overridden everytime a new work is published.



## Impact
An old referrer can be denied of his share of fee which he is applicable to receive. Here loss of funds is for the previous referres.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't what can be exact mitigation for this one , one can be to stores referrers[edition] as a mapping from a edition to an array of referrers which are added whenever a new work is published and distribute the collection referrer share fees to all of them equally.
