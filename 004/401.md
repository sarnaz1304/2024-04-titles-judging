# `Edition::transferWork` function doesn't change the receiver of the `_feeReceivers`

## Summary

The [Edition::transferWork](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L412) function is designed to transfer the work to other user and change the creator of the work. However it doesn't change the receiver of the transferred `tokenId` in the `_feeReceivers` mapping.

## Vulnerability Detail


The [Edition::transferWork](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L412) function is designed to allow sending a token to another user. However, the current implementation of the function doesn't change the receiver of the transferred token in the `_feeReceivers` mapping and the new creator is not able to get the fee shares.

The current implementation of the `Edition::transferWork` function is as follows:

```soldity
Edition.sol
412: function transferWork(address to_, uint256 tokenId_) external {
413:         Work storage work = works[tokenId_];
414:         if (msg.sender != work.creator) revert Unauthorized();
415: 
416:         // Transfer the work to the new creator
417:         work.creator = to_;
418: 
419:         emit WorkTransferred(address(this), tokenId_, to_);
420:     }
```

As evident from the provided code, at [L417](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L417) the creator is changed.

When publishing a new work, the creator is set as the first target in the splitFactory.

```solidity
TitlesCore.sol
120: function _publish(Edition edition_, WorkPayload memory work_, address referrer_)
121:         internal
122:         returns (uint256 tokenId)
123:     {
124:         // Publish the new Work in the Edition
125:         // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
126:         tokenId = edition_.publish(
127:             work_.creator.target,
128:             work_.maxSupply,
129:             work_.opensAt,
130:             work_.closesAt,
131:             work_.attributions,
132:             work_.strategy,
133:             work_.metadata
134:         );
135: 
136:         // Collect the creation fee
137:         // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
138:         feeManager.collectCreationFee{value: msg.value}(edition_, tokenId, msg.sender);
139: 
140:         // Create the fee route for the new Work
141:         // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
142:         Target memory feeReceiver = feeManager.createRoute( //@audit-info create route
143:             edition_, tokenId, _attributionTargets(work_.attributions), referrer_
144:         );
145: 
146:         // Set the royalty target for the new Work
147:         // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
148:         edition_.setRoyaltyTarget(tokenId, feeReceiver.target);
149:     }
```

The implementation of the `FeeManager::createRoute` is as follows:

```solidity
FeeManager.sol
125: function createRoute(
126:         IEdition edition_,
127:         uint256 tokenId_,
128:         Target[] calldata attributions_,
129:         address referrer_
130:     ) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) returns (Target memory receiver) {
131:         Target memory creator = edition_.node(tokenId_).creator;
132: 
133:         if (attributions_.length == 0) {
134:             // No attributions, pay the creator directly
135:             receiver = creator;
136:         } else {
137:             // Distribute the fee among the creator and attributions
138:             (address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory revshares) = _buildSharesAndTargets(//@audit-info creator = targets[0]
139:                 creator, attributions_, edition_.feeStrategy(tokenId_).revshareBps
140:             );
141: 
142:             // Create the split. The protocol retains "ownership" to enable future use cases.
143:             receiver = Target({ //@audit-info creator is kept in the receiver
144:                 target: splitFactory.createSplit(
145:                     SplitV2Lib.Split({
146:                         recipients: targets,
147:                         allocations: revshares,
148:                         totalAllocation: 1e6,
149:                         distributionIncentive: 0
150:                     }),
151:                     address(this),
152:                     creator.target
153:                     ),
154:                 chainId: creator.chainId
155:             });
156:         }
157: 
158:         _feeReceivers[getRouteId(edition_, tokenId_)] = receiver; //@audit set receiver here
159:         referrers[edition_] = referrer_;
160:     }
```
At [L138](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L138) the creator is set as the targets[0].

```solidity
FeeManager.sol
476: function _buildSharesAndTargets(
477:         Target memory creator,
478:         Target[] memory attributions,
479:         uint32 revshareBps
480:     ) internal pure returns (address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory shares) {
481:         uint32 attributionShares = uint32(attributions.length);
482:         uint32 attributionRevShare = revshareBps * 100 / attributionShares;
483:         uint32 creatorShare = 1e6 - (attributionRevShare * attributionShares);
484: 
485:         // Build the targets and shares arrays using this layout:
486:         // - targets: [creator, ...attributions]
487:         // - shares: [creatorShare, ...attributionShares]
488:         targets = new address[](attributionShares + 1);
489:         shares = new uint256[](attributionShares + 1);
490: 
491:         targets[0] = creator.target; //@audit creator is set as targets[0]
492:         shares[0] = creatorShare;
493: 
494:         for (uint8 i = 0; i < attributionShares; i++) {
495:             targets[i + 1] = attributions[i].target;
496:             shares[i + 1] = attributionRevShare;
497:         }
498:     }
```

As evident from provided code, the creator is set as targets[0] and saved in the `_feeReceiver` mapping. However the `transferWork` doesn't change the creator of the mapping and new creator is not able receive the fee share.

On the other hand, in [Edition::publish]() function, the `edges` are created according to the creator from L127 below.

```solidity
File: Edition.sol
103:     function publish(
104:         address creator_,
105:         uint256 maxSupply_,
106:         uint64 opensAt_,
107:         uint64 closesAt_,
108:         Node[] calldata attributions_,
109:         Strategy calldata strategy_,
110:         Metadata calldata metadata_
111:     ) external override onlyRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE) returns (uint256 tokenId) {
             [...]
125:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < attributions_.length; i++) {
126:             // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy, unchecked-return-value
127:             GRAPH.createEdge(_node, attributions_[i], attributions_[i].data);
128:         }
129: 
130:         emit Published(address(this), tokenId);
131:     }
```

So, if the creator is changed by calling `transferWork` function, the `edges` related to the creator must be recreated.

## Impact

The new creator is not able to receive the fee share and `edges` are not updated according to new creator.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to update the receiver of the `_feeReceivers` and `edges` according to new creator.
