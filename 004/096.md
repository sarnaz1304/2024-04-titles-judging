# Some info is not updated if a work gets tranferred

## Summary
Edges in the graph contract, and the mint fee receivers in the `FeeManager` are not updated in response to work transfer. In some cases, those values can never be updated.

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon a work's creation and publish, the core contracts will try to create an entry in the `FeeManager` contract. The work piece's fee share info will be recorded. A route will be created in response to this in [`createRoute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L125) function:

```solidity
    function createRoute(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        Target[] calldata attributions_,
        address referrer_
    ) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) returns (Target memory receiver) {
        Target memory creator = edition_.node(tokenId_).creator;

        if (attributions_.length == 0) {
            // No attributions, pay the creator directly
            receiver = creator;
        } else {
            // Distribute the fee among the creator and attributions
            (address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory revshares) = _buildSharesAndTargets(
                creator, attributions_, edition_.feeStrategy(tokenId_).revshareBps
            );

            // Create the split. The protocol retains "ownership" to enable future use cases.
            receiver = Target({
                target: splitFactory.createSplit(
                    SplitV2Lib.Split({
                        recipients: targets,
                        allocations: revshares,
                        totalAllocation: 1e6,
                        distributionIncentive: 0
                    }),
                    address(this),
                    creator.target
                    ),
                chainId: creator.chainId
            });
        }

        _feeReceivers[getRouteId(edition_, tokenId_)] = receiver;
        referrers[edition_] = referrer_;
    }
```

The fee receiver is set to the creator of the piece and stored in `_feeReceivers` map. The `node` function returns value by the following logic:

```solidity
    function node(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (Node memory) {
        return Node({
            nodeType: NodeType.TOKEN_ERC1155,
            creator: Target({target: works[tokenId].creator, chainId: block.chainid}),
            entity: Target({target: address(this), chainId: block.chainid}),
            data: abi.encode(tokenId)
        });
    }
```

It takes the work's creator and set the `creator` field. When the work is transferred in `Edition` contract, the work's creator role is updated to the new one:

```solidity
    function transferWork(address to_, uint256 tokenId_) external {
        Work storage work = works[tokenId_];
        if (msg.sender != work.creator) revert Unauthorized();

        // Transfer the work to the new creator
        work.creator = to_;

        emit WorkTransferred(address(this), tokenId_, to_);
    }
```

But the fee receiver address is not updated. The only likely way of updating such value is by calling `createRoute` again, this may also fail if the work has attribute shares before:

```solidity
    function createRoute(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        Target[] calldata attributions_,
        address referrer_
    ) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) returns (Target memory receiver) {
        Target memory creator = edition_.node(tokenId_).creator;

        if (attributions_.length == 0) {
            // No attributions, pay the creator directly
            receiver = creator;
        } else {
            // Distribute the fee among the creator and attributions
            (address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory revshares) = _buildSharesAndTargets(
                creator, attributions_, edition_.feeStrategy(tokenId_).revshareBps
            );

            // Create the split. The protocol retains "ownership" to enable future use cases.
            receiver = Target({
                target: splitFactory.createSplit(
                    SplitV2Lib.Split({
                        recipients: targets,
                        allocations: revshares,
                        totalAllocation: 1e6,
                        distributionIncentive: 0
                    }),
                    address(this),
                    creator.target
                    ),
                chainId: creator.chainId
            });
        }

        _feeReceivers[getRouteId(edition_, tokenId_)] = receiver;
        referrers[edition_] = referrer_;
    }
```

When there are attribute splits, the split factory would try to create a new split, which would fail as there is an existing one. 

Another issue is in `TitlesGraph` contract, where edge info is not updated with the transfer, also no way of updating it, too.

## Impact
New creator of the work may lose some minting fees, or even not being able to get fees at all, and new creator is not reflected on old edges which are created before transfer.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function transferWork(address to_, uint256 tokenId_) external {
        Work storage work = works[tokenId_];
        if (msg.sender != work.creator) revert Unauthorized();

        // Transfer the work to the new creator
        work.creator = to_;

        emit WorkTransferred(address(this), tokenId_, to_);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Provide a function for updating creator reflecting to work transfer.
