# Edition.sol is missing some GRAPH integrations, which will make accesing some functionality difficult

## Summary

`Edition.sol` is missing some `GRAPH` functionality that can make it difficult for users to interact with the `GRAPH` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Edition manager is able to publish edges for multiple `attributions_`:

[Edition::publish()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L103-L128)
```solidity
    function publish(
        address creator_,
        uint256 maxSupply_,
        uint64 opensAt_,
        uint64 closesAt_,
        Node[] calldata attributions_,
        Strategy calldata strategy_,
        Metadata calldata metadata_
    ) external override onlyRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE) returns (uint256 tokenId) {
        tokenId = ++totalWorks;

        _metadata[tokenId] = metadata_;
        works[tokenId] = Work({
            creator: creator_,
            totalSupply: 0,
            maxSupply: maxSupply_,
            opensAt: opensAt_,
            closesAt: closesAt_,
            strategy: FEE_MANAGER.validateStrategy(strategy_)
        });

        Node memory _node = node(tokenId);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < attributions_.length; i++) {
            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy, unchecked-return-value
            GRAPH.createEdge(_node, attributions_[i], attributions_[i].data);
        }
```

[`GRAPH::createEdge()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L82-L95) calls `GRAPH::_createEdge()` where `acknowledged` is set to `false`:
```solidity
   function _createEdge(Node memory from_, Node memory to_, bytes memory data_)
        internal
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        bytes32 edgeId = keccak256(abi.encode(from_, to_)); // @audit only 1 edge between each pair of nodes
        if (!_edgeIds.add(edgeId)) revert Exists();

        edge = Edge({from: from_, to: to_, acknowledged: false, data: data_});
        edges[edgeId] = edge;

        emit NodeTouched(from_, data_);
        emit NodeTouched(to_, data_);
        emit EdgeCreated(edge, data_);
    }
```
The attribution node passed into `TitlesGraph::createEdge()` can acknowledge the edge to set it to true, I.e. the attributer is endoring the Edition or Work (which can be used in front-end or for future functionality). However the `Editions` contract does not have a function that allows for this functionality, and it also does not store the returned EdgeId from `TitlesGraph::createEdge()`. The acknowledgement can still be set to `true` by directly calling the GRAPH contract, however the caller will have to call multiple helper functions to retrieve the `EdgeId` and go through the process themselves, which can be challenging. Considering that `attributers` can be a non-TILES art pieces, then for the creator of that NFT to endorese a TILES work should be as easy as possible, i.e. interacting with the Edition contract itself, rather than having to find the GRAPH contract and calling functions within that contract themselves.

The Editions contract should also keep track of `EdgeId` (or have a way within the contrac to retrieve `EdgeId`s and provide functions to access functionality within `GRAPH` related to Edges that are specific to each `Edition` and the `Works` within that `Edition`.

## Impact

`GRAPH` integration within `Edition` is not complete, missing the tracking of `Edition` realted `EdgeIds` (or a way to call GRAPH getter functions to get the `EdgeId`) and it doesn't contain forwarding functions to make calling the `GRAPH` contract function through the `Edition` contract itself. This can make the `GRAPH` intergration difficult for users to understand and interact with, which can cause users to not bother acknowledging Edges or interacting with the necessary functionality, which will limit the use of this functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Provide functions within `Edition.sol` that match the required functionality from GRAPH for proper utilisation of all the features related to the editions and works (such as acknowledgements).
