# The mint fees is sent to the old creator even after updating the creator with `transferWork()`

## Summary
Each publication has a creator, who receives a mint fee each time their publication is minted. This creator can choose to transfer their work to another creator, thereby transferring all the control and responsibility of the publication to the new creator. 
However, in doing so by calling the `transferWork()` function, the fee route in `FeeManager.sol` is not updated, which means the old creator still receives the mint fees. There is no way for the old creator/ new creator to change this route.
## Vulnerability Detail
The discrepancy lies in the [`transferWork()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L412) function, it does not update the fee route of the work in the `FeeManager.sol` contract :
```solidity
function transferWork(address to_, uint256 tokenId_) external {
        Work storage work = works[tokenId_];
        if (msg.sender != work.creator) revert Unauthorized();

        // Transfer the work to the new creator
        work.creator = to_;

        emit WorkTransferred(address(this), tokenId_, to_);
    }
```
`FeeManager.sol`'s `createRoute()` function, which can be utilized here to update the fee route, can only be called by the admin or the owner (the `TitlesCore.sol` contract) of the `FeeManager.sol` contract. Therefore, there's no way for the old/new creator to route the incoming mint fee to the new creator.

## Recommendation
Re-factor the `createRoute()` function to allow the creator to update the fee route of their own publication.
