# Updated strategy is not reflected in royalty

## Summary

The creator of a work is able to update the strategy of their work using `setFeeStrategy` function. However, it does not update automatically work's `royaltyBps` and royalty fee stays the same.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a new work is published in the edition via `TitlesCore` contract's `_publish` function, the [royalty is set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol#L148) using the strategy that was passed in the work's payload parameter.

Later, the creator is able to update the work's fee strategy using `setFeeStrategy` function. When it is updated, the strategy is validated and stored in `strategy` field. However, the royalty is not updated and the royalty fee stays the same.

## Impact

The royalty fee is not updated when strategy is updated.
