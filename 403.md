# Limitation of Revenue Due to Hardcoded `MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE`

## Summary

The hardcoded `MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE` in the `FeeManager` contract could restrict revenue generation on different blockchain networks where the value of ether significantly differs, such as on the `DEGEN` chain.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `FeeManager` contract sets `MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE` to `0.1 ether`. On blockchain networks like the `DEGEN` chain, where `0.1 ether` equates to only `$0.0028` (https://explorer.degen.tips/), this limitation drastically reduces potential revenue from fees.

## Impact

This is a medium severity issue as it directly affects the economic model of the platform on chains with a lower ether value.

    /// @dev The maximum protocol fee in wei. Applies to both flat and percentage fees.
    uint64 public constant MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE = 0.1 ether;
```

## Recommendation

Consider making `MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE` adjustable.
