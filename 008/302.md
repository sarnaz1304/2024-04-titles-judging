# Transferring ownership does not fully transfer ownership

## Summary
The old owner still receives minting proceeds even though the old owner has transferred the ownership.
## Vulnerability Detail
As per the [README.md](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/c9d16782a7d3c15c7a759f22c9e0552d5e777ed7/README.md?plain=1#L66):
```md
Transfer full ownership of the work to a new address (`transferWork`). This is the only way to change the creator for a work.
```

A creator can call `transferWork()` to transfer full ownership to another address:
```javascript
    function transferWork(address to_, uint256 tokenId_) external {
        Work storage work = works[tokenId_];
        if (msg.sender != work.creator) revert Unauthorized();
        work.creator = to_;
        emit WorkTransferred(address(this), tokenId_, to_);
    }
```

The problem is, even if a creator transfers full ownership to another address, the old creator will still receive the minting funds.
## Proof of Concept
Run this test in `Edition.t.sol`:
```javascript
    function test_poc_transfer_work() public {
        // Prank as the creator and transferWork to `address(2)`
        vm.prank(address(1));
        edition.transferWork(address(2), 1);

        // Ensure that the creator is now `address(2)`
        assertEq(edition.creator(1), address(2));
        
        // Mint twice and check if the proceeds go to the old creator, `address(1)`
        edition.mint{value: 0.0106 ether}(address(1), 1, 1, address(0), new bytes(0));
        edition.mint{value: 0.0106 ether}(address(1), 1, 1, address(0), new bytes(0));

        // Assert two mints
        assertEq(edition.totalSupply(1), 2);

        // Assert that the old creator received the minting proceeds
        assertEq(address(1).balance, 0.02 ether);
    }
```
This test will successfully run - the minting proceeds will go to the old creator even though the ownership has been fully transferred to a new address.

## Impact
Loss of minting proceeds, which is significant.
Imagine a big AI artist selling one of their works to a buyer. The big AI artist transfers ownership to the buyer but little does the buyer know the big AI artist will still be receiving newly minted proceeds.

## Recommendation
Route the minting proceeds to the creator, not the old creator.
