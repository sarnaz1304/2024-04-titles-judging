# FeeManager uses MAX_BPS rather than MAX_ROYALTY_BPS when checking max referrer shares, leading to protocol loss of fees

## Summary

When `FeeManager::setProtocolFees()` verifies `mintReferrerRevshareBps_` and `collectionReferrerRevshareBps_` combined value, the maximum allowed value is incorrect used. The comments state that these two values combined should not be more than `MAX_ROYALTY_BPS` however currently these values are compared to `MAX_BPS`.

## Vulnerability Detail

[FeeManager::setProtocolFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L291-L311)
```solidity
    /// @notice Updates the protocol fees which are collected for various actions.
    /// @param protocolCreationFee_ The new protocol creation fee. This fee is collected when a new {Edition} is created. Cannot exceed {MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE}.
    /// @param protocolFlatFee_ The new protocol flat fee. This fee is collected on all mint transactions. Cannot exceed {MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE}.
    /// @param protocolFeeShareBps_ The new protocol fee share in basis points. Cannot exceed {MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS}.
    /// @param mintReferrerRevshareBps_ The new mint referrer revenue share in basis points. This plus the collection referrer share cannot exceed {MAX_ROYALTY_BPS}.
    /// @param collectionReferrerRevshareBps_ The new collection referrer revenue share in basis points. This plus the mint referrer share cannot exceed {MAX_ROYALTY_BPS}.
    /// @dev This function can only be called by the owner or an admin.
    function setProtocolFees(
        uint64 protocolCreationFee_,
        uint64 protocolFlatFee_,
        uint16 protocolFeeShareBps_,
        uint16 mintReferrerRevshareBps_,
        uint16 collectionReferrerRevshareBps_
    ) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) {
        if (
            protocolCreationFee_ > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE || protocolFlatFee_ > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE
                || protocolFeeShareBps_ > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS
                || (mintReferrerRevshareBps_ + collectionReferrerRevshareBps_) > MAX_BPS 
        ) {
            revert InvalidFee();
        }
```
The comments above `setProtocolFees` state that :
```solidity
    /// @param mintReferrerRevshareBps_ The new mint referrer revenue share in basis points. This plus the collection referrer share cannot exceed {MAX_ROYALTY_BPS}.
    /// @param collectionReferrerRevshareBps_ The new collection referrer revenue share in basis points. This plus the mint referrer share cannot exceed {MAX_ROYALTY_BPS}.
```
However currently the check is:
```solidity
(mintReferrerRevshareBps_ + collectionReferrerRevshareBps_) > MAX_BPS 
```

when it should be:
```solidity
(mintReferrerRevshareBps_ + collectionReferrerRevshareBps_) > MAX_ROYALTY_BPS 
```

## Impact

The referral fees can currently be 100% of the total BPS, however the maximum cap should be 95%. Meaning that no funds will be transfered to the protocol, when there should be a minimum of 5% always sent to the protocol. Currently if the fees are set to the maximums allowed within the code, that during `FeeManager::_splitProtocolFee()` the fees for the referrers will 100%, effectivelly stealing the minimum amount that should alawys sent to the protocol. This will result in the protocol losing out on fees.

## Recommendation

Change `MAX_BPS` to `MAX_ROYALTY_BPS` as shown below:

[FeeManager.sol#L308](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L308)
```diff
 -              || (mintReferrerRevshareBps_ + collectionReferrerRevshareBps_) > MAX_BPS
 +              || (mintReferrerRevshareBps_ + collectionReferrerRevshareBps_) > MAX_ROYALTY_BPS
```
