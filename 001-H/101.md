# Malicious users can exploit a flaw in `mintBatch()` to mint large amounts of tokens, with very little cost

## Summary
See detail.

## Vulnerability Detail
This vulnerability lies in version of `mintBatch()` which mints the same token to multiple receivers (function signature `mintBatch(address[],uint256,uint256,bytes)`.

It charges the user a mintFee for `amount_` tokens, but it actually mints `receivers_.length * amount_` tokens within the for-loop.

See implementation here:
```solidity
function mintBatch(
    address[] calldata receivers_,
    uint256 tokenId_,
    uint256 amount_,
    bytes calldata data_
) external payable {

    FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
        this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
    );

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
        _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
    }

    _refundExcess();
}
```
## Impact
Users can mint large numbers of tokens, by paying a very small price, completely devaluing the tokens and stealing from the protocol.

Example scenario: calling `mintBatch()` with `receivers_.length = 100`, and `amount_ = 1`. The user pays a fee for 1 token, but mints 100 tokens, exploiting the incorrect logic. This can be done repeatedly, even at a larger scale with very little cost.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the mintFee for `amount_ * receivers_.length` tokens, rather than just `amount_` tokens.
