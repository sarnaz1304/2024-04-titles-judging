# [M2] `Edition::mintBatch` will revert if you try to mint more than 1 NFTs

## Summary
The `mintBatch` function is designed to facilitate the minting of multiple NFTs in a single transaction. However, it encounters an issue where it fails to mint more than one NFT due to a problem with the handling of `msg.value` during the fee collection process. Specifically, the function sends the entire `msg.value` to `FeeManager::collectMintFee` on the first iteration, leaving no funds for subsequent iterations, which results in a transaction revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintBatch` function is intended to allow for the minting of multiple quantities of NFTs for multiple works. It accepts an array of token IDs and corresponding amounts, along with other necessary parameters. The function iterates over these inputs, calling `FeeManager::collectMintFee` for each token ID to collect the minting fee. However, during the first iteration of this loop, the function transfers the entire `msg.value` to `collectMintFee`. This action depletes the value, leaving none for the subsequent token IDs, causing the function to revert when attempting to mint more than one NFT.

```javascript
function mintBatch1(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
            FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}( 
                this,
                tokenIds_[i],
                amounts_[i],
                msg.sender,
                address(0),
                work.strategy
            );

            _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
            _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
        }

        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
## Impact
It prevents users from minting more than one NFT in a single transaction, which could lead to a poor user experience, more gas cost and hinder the application's intended use. Additionally, if there is more ETH sotred in this contract, this issue could be exploited by malicious actors to intentionally to mint NFTs for free. but since there is almost no intended way to deposit ETH to this contract and all deposited ETH goes immidietly to `FeeManager` contract, probability of this to happen seems low.

## Code Snippet
Here is a simple Test you can add to existing test suit to fix this issue:
1. Add a 2nd token Id to existing `Edition.t.sol::setUp` function:
<details>
<summary> setUp function changes:</summary>

```diff
function setUp() public {
        edition = new Edition();
        feeManager = new FeeManager(
            address(0xdeadbeef),
            address(0xc0ffee),
            address(new MockSplitFactory())
        );
        graph = new TitlesGraph(address(this), address(this));

        edition.initialize(
            feeManager,
            graph,
            address(this),
            address(this),
            Metadata({
                label: "Test Edition",
                uri: "ipfs.io/test-edition",
                data: new bytes(0)
            })
        );

-       edition.publish(
+       uint256 tId2 = edition.publish(
            address(1), // creator
            10, // maxSupply
            0, // opensAt
            0, // closesAt
            new Node[](0), // attributions
            Strategy({
                asset: address(0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE),
                mintFee: 0.01 ether,
                revshareBps: 2500, // 25%
                royaltyBps: 250 // 2.5%
            }),
            Metadata({
                label: "Best Work Ever",
                uri: "ipfs.io/best-work-ever",
                data: new bytes(0)
            })
        );
+       uint256 tId2 = edition.publish(
+           address(1), // creator
+           10, // maxSupply
+           0, // opensAt
+           0, // closesAt
+           new Node[](0), // attributions
+           Strategy({
+               asset: address(0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE),
+               mintFee: 0.01 ether,
+               revshareBps: 2500, // 25%
+               royaltyBps: 250 // 2.5%
+           }),
+           Metadata({
+               label: "Best Work Ever",
+               uri: "ipfs.io/best-work-ever",
+               data: new bytes(0)
+           })
+       );
+       assert(tId1 == 1);
+       assert(tId2 == 2);  // check tokenIds are correctly created

        // Normally done by the TitlesCore, but we're testing in isolation
        feeManager.createRoute(edition, 1, new Target[](0), address(0));
+       feeManager.createRoute(edition, 2, new Target[](0), address(0)); // add route for 2nd tokenId
    }
```
</details>

2. add this test function to `Edition.t.sol::setUp`:
<details>
<summary> PoC: </summary>

```javascript
 function test_mintBatch1() public {
        address user = makeAddr("user");
        //minting 1 of each tokenId
        uint256[] memory tokenIds = new uint256[](2);
        tokenIds[0] = 1;
        tokenIds[1] = 2;
        uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](2);
        amounts[0] = 1;
        amounts[1] = 1;
        vm.startPrank(user);
        vm.deal(user, 1 ether);
        vm.expectRevert();
        edition.mintBatch1{value: 0.0212 ether}(
            user,
            tokenIds,
            amounts,
            new bytes(0)
        );
    }
```
</details>


## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation 
To mitigate this issue, the `mintBatch` function should be modified to correctly distribute `msg.value` among all the NFTs being minted. This can be achieved by calculating the fee for each NFT individually and then subtracting this fee from `msg.value` before it is passed to the `collectMintFee` function. Here's a proposed implementation:
Note that function name is changed to `mintBatch1` just to get rid of foundry errors.

```diff
function mintBatch1(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];
+           uint256 ithMintFee = mintFee(i + 1); // get the mint fee for i+1 th tokenId note that tokenId starts from 1 not 0
            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
-           FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
+           FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: ithMintFee* amounts_[i]}(
                this,
                tokenIds_[i],
                amounts_[i],
                msg.sender,
                address(0),
                work.strategy
            );

            _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
            _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
        }

        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
