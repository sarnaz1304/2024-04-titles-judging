# A user can mint tokens of `tokenId` at a much lower cost due to incorrect fee collection logic in `Edition.sol`

## Summary
Every time tokens of `tokenId` are minted, a fee is collected on the mint based on the amount of tokens minted. However due to incorrect logic of fee collection in [`Edition.sol::mintBatch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L304), a user can do this at a much lower cost.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `mintBatch()` function in `Edition.sol` takes in the following inputs : 

- `amount_` : The amount of `tokenId` tokens to mint to each receiver
- `receivers_` : Array of receivers to mint `amount_` quantity of `tokenId_` tokens _each_ to

Before issuing tokens, a fee is paid by the user which depends on the amount of tokens that are minted by the user. However, in this function, the user is only charged for `amount_` quantity of tokens even though they are allowed to mint `receivers_.length * amount_` quantity of tokens : 
```solidity
  function mintBatch(
        address[] calldata receivers_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
@>        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy // notice how only `amount_` is inputted in the function call
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_); // this loop allows the user to mint `receivers_.length * amount_` tokens
        }

        _refundExcess();
    }
```
A malicious user can use this vulnerability to their benefit by injecting their address multiple times into `receivers_` array and mint tokens in quantities that are multiples of `amount_` while only paying for `amount_` quantity of tokens.

## Recommendation
Alter [`Edition.sol::#L312`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L312) as follows :
```diff
         FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
-            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
+            this, tokenId_, amount_*receivers_.length, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
         );
```
