# `Edition::mintBatch(address[] calldata receivers_, ...)` calculates incorrect fees for minters

## Summary

`Edition::mintBatch(address[] calldata receivers_, ...)` allows minters to mint the same `work` (`tokenId`) to several `receivers`, but does not charge fees for the equivalent amount of tokens minted.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Edition::mintBatch(address[] calldata receivers_, ...)` charges the mint fee only on the `amount` sent as argument, but an array of `receivers` will receive the tokens. This means that minters are able to mint tokens `n` times cheaper than expected. For example, if a minter wants to mint `10` tokens, it would pay `amount * totalFees = 10 * totalFees`. However, the minter is able to call `Edition::mintBatch(address[] calldata receivers_, ...)`  with an amount of `1` and `10` receivers (its address) and pay `10` times less fees.

## Impact

Fee manipulation and severe yield loss for everyone involved except the minter.

## Code Snippet

[Edition::mintBatch(address[] calldata receivers_, ...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L304):
```solidity
function mintBatch(
    address[] calldata receivers_,
    uint256 tokenId_,
    uint256 amount_,
    bytes calldata data_
) external payable {
    // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
    FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
        this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
    );

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
        _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
    }

    _refundExcess();
}
```

Vscode

## Recommendation

The fees charged should be `amount * receivers.length`.
