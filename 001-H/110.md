# Denial of Service (DOS) Vulnerability in `Edition.sol#mintBatch()`

## Summary
The `Edition.sol#mintBatch()` function is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DOS) attack due to an inconsistency in the amount of ETH (`msg.value`) received from the caller and the amount transferred to `FeeManager`. 
This discrepancy leads to a situation where the ETH balance in `Edition` is insufficient to cover the fees transferred to `FeeManager`.
## Vulnerability Detail
Within the `Edition.sol#mintBatch()` function, the issue arises because the ETH received from the caller (`msg.value`) is not correctly calculated to cover the fees transferred to `FeeManager`.
```solidity
    function mintBatch(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
283:    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
284:        Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
287:        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
288:            this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
289:        );

291:        _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
292:        _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
293:    }

        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
As you can see, ETH corresponding to the amount of ETH that `Edition` receives from the caller (i.e. `msg.value`) is repeatedly transferred to `FeeManager`.
However, Since the amount transferred to `FeeManager` is smaller than the amount received from the caller, the ETH balance of `Edition` is insufficient to cover the amount of transmission.
As a result, a permanent DOS occurs due to insufficient ETH balance.
## Impact
The vulnerability  is that a permanent DOS occurs due to the mismatch between the ETH received and the fees transferred to `FeeManager` in the `Edition.sol#mintBatch()` function.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address the DOS vulnerability in the `Edition.sol#mintBatch()` function, it is recommended to adjust the fee calculation process to ensure that the correct amount of ETH is transferred to `FeeManager`.
```solidity
    function mintBatch(
        address to_,
        uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
        uint256[] calldata amounts_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
            Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];

            // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
---         FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
---             this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
---         );

+++         FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: FEE_MANAGER.getMintFee(work.strategy, amount_[i])}(
+++             this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
+++         );

            _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
            _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
        }

        _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
        _refundExcess();
    }
```
By implementing this modification, the `Edition.sol#mintBatch()` function will accurately calculate and transfer the required amount of ETH to `FeeManager`, mitigating the DOS vulnerability caused by the discrepancy in fee handling.
