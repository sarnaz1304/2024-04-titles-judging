# signature check can be passed in TitleGraphs——no nonce check in signature

## Summary
Signature Check can be passed in TitleGraphs

## Vulnerability Detail
acknowledgeEdge and unacknowledgeEdge have the version of using signature, but signature check is useless.

1. Because all the paremeters are controlled by users, and the check is the hash of the signature. So if a user can get a valid signature, then he can get another valid signature. https://hackernoon.com/what-is-the-math-behind-elliptic-curve-cryptography-f61b25253da3
2. Because the signature doesn't have a nonce, so there is no order check. When a user get a signature, he can wait until other users use their signature and then submit his tx to use his signature. 

## Impact
Signature misuse

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L40
```solidity
  modifier checkSignature(bytes32 edgeId, bytes calldata data, bytes calldata signature) {
      bytes32 digest = _hashTypedData(keccak256(abi.encode(ACK_TYPEHASH, edgeId, data)));
      if (
          !edges[edgeId].to.creator.target.isValidSignatureNowCalldata(digest, signature)
              || _isUsed[keccak256(signature)]
      ) {
          revert Unauthorized();
      }
      _;
      _isUsed[keccak256(signature)] = true;
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a nonce check or timestamp in signature
