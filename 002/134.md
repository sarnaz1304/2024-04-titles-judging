# The signature does not contain options such that the signature can be used to arbitrarily choose whether to ack or unack.

## Summary
The signature does not contain options such that the signature can be used to arbitrarily choose whether to ack or unack.

## Vulnerability Detail
The signature does not contain options such that the signature can be used to arbitrarily choose whether to ack or unack.

So an attacker can monitor the mempool, and use the same paremeters to front-run the function but use a different function. Like victim use a acknowledgeEdge but attacker can front-run to call unacknowledgeEdge. And when the victim use his signature, because the hash is in _isUsed map,so his tx will be revert.

## Impact
Front-run leads to total different situation.


## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L118
```solidity
    function acknowledgeEdge(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bytes calldata signature_)
        external
        checkSignature(edgeId_, data_, signature_)
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        return _setAcknowledged(edgeId_, data_, true);
    }
    function unacknowledgeEdge(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bytes calldata signature_)
        external
        checkSignature(edgeId_, data_, signature_)
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        return _setAcknowledged(edgeId_, data_, false);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add ack or unack paremeter in signature hash.
