# Attacker can front-run `acknowledgeEdge` and `unacknowledgeEdge`, causing DoS

## Summary
`TitlesGraph::acknowledgeEdge` and `TitlesGraph::unacknowledgeEdge` and both susceptible to front-run attacks.

When a call to `acknowledgeEdge` is made, an attacker can extract the parameters, including the signature, and call `unacknowledgeEdge` instead. When the user's call to `acknowledgeEdge` is executed, it will revert since the signature has already been used, therefore user will not be able to acknowledge the edge. This can be done for `unacknowledgeEdge` as well, effectively causing DoS of acknowledging and unacknowledging edges via front-run.

## Vulnerability Detail
`TitlesGraph::acknowledgeEdge` [#L118](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L118)
```javascript
    function acknowledgeEdge(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bytes calldata signature_)
        external
@>      checkSignature(edgeId_, data_, signature_)
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        return _setAcknowledged(edgeId_, data_, true);
    }
```

`TitlesGraph::unacknowledgeEdge` [#L146](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L146)
```javascript
    function unacknowledgeEdge(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bytes calldata signature_)
        external
@>      checkSignature(edgeId_, data_, signature_)
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        return _setAcknowledged(edgeId_, data_, false);
    }
```

`TitlesGraph::checkSignature` 
```javascript
    modifier checkSignature(bytes32 edgeId, bytes calldata data, bytes calldata signature) {
        bytes32 digest = _hashTypedData(keccak256(abi.encode(ACK_TYPEHASH, edgeId, data)));
        if (
            !edges[edgeId].to.creator.target.isValidSignatureNowCalldata(digest, signature)
                || _isUsed[keccak256(signature)]
        ) {
@>          revert Unauthorized();
        }
        _;
@>      _isUsed[keccak256(signature)] = true;
    }
```

Both functions require signatures that is checked via the `checkSignature` modifier. If the signature has already been used, the call will revert. The problem is that both function calls can be front-run, allowing the following scenarios:

`unacknowledgeEdge` front-run: Attacker extracts parameters and calls `acknowledgeEdge` with the same signature. Once the call to `unacknowledgeEdge` is executed, it will revert since the signature has already been used. The caller will not be able to unacknowledge the edge.

`acknowledgeEdge` front-run: Attacker extracts parameters and calls `unacknowledgeEdge`  with the same signature. Once the call to `acknowledgeEdge` is executed, it will revert since the signature has already been used. The caller will not be able to acknowledge the edge.

## Impact
Denial of Service of acknowledging and unacknowledging edges, causing discrepancies and manipulation with the status of edges.
