# The project may fail to be deployed to chains that do not support the `PUSH0` opcode.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
As clearly mentioned in the `readme` file 
![image](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles-maushish/assets/114429859/0c25efa0-9769-4f93-b00a-54c595e6e9b9)
Contracts will be getting deployed to multiple chains out of these chains [zkSYNC doesnt support `PUSH0` opcode yet.](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/components/compiler/specification/instructions/evmla.html#push)
Due to which the bytecode generated by the contracts will not be compatible with the zkSync chain.
This could also become a problem if different versions of Solidity are used to compile contracts for different chains. The differences in bytecode between versions can impact the deterministic nature of contract addresses, potentially breaking counterfactuality.
## Impact
Explained above
## Code Snippet
As of now Optimism, Arbitrum, supports `PUSH0` opcode.
[here you can check the evm opcodes](https://www.evm.codes/)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
remove the support of zkSync for now or use 0.8.19.
