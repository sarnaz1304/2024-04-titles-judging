# The edges will never be acknowledged because only memory copy is modified

## Summary
`Node`s and `Edge`s `acknowledged` status can't be set.

## Vulnerability Detail

`TitlesGraph._setAcknowledged` creates a memory copy of edges[edgeId_]. Then the acknowledge status of the copy variable is updaetd but the original storage variable remains unchanged.

```solidity
    function _setAcknowledged(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bool acknowledged_)
        internal
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        if (!_edgeIds.contains(edgeId_)) revert NotFound();
        edge = edges[edgeId_]; // @audit a copy is made in memory
        edge.acknowledged = acknowledged_; //@audit update the copy


        if (acknowledged_) {
            emit EdgeAcknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
        } else {
            emit EdgeUnacknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
The edges acknowledged status can't be updated. 
The owners of referenced collection can't endorse the reference Node/ Edge.

## Recommendation
Update the `_setAcknowledged` function as follow: 

```solidity
    function _setAcknowledged(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bool acknowledged_)
        internal
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        if (!_edgeIds.contains(edgeId_)) revert NotFound();
+        edges[edgeId_].acknowledged  = acknowledged_;
        edge = edges[edgeId_];
-        edge.acknowledged = acknowledged_;
...

```
