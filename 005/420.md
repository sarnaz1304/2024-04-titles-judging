# Title: Failure to Update Edge Acknowledgment Status in Storage

## Summary
The acknowledgeEdge function does not update the acknowledgment status in storage properly, as it modifies the Edge struct only in memory. This can lead to incorrect acknowledgment status representation in the contract's state.

## Vulnerability Detail
n the _setAcknowledged internal function, the acknowledgment status of the edge is updated only in memory, but it is not reflected in storage. Consequently, the acknowledgment status of the edge remains unchanged in the contract's state.

## Impact
The incorrect handling of acknowledgment status can result in inconsistencies between the contract's internal state and the actual status of edges in the graph. This could lead to incorrect behavior in applications relying on the acknowledgment status of edges.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L202
```javascript
function _setAcknowledged(
        bytes32 edgeId_,
        bytes calldata data_,
        bool acknowledged_
    ) internal returns (Edge memory edge) {
        if (!_edgeIds.contains(edgeId_)) revert NotFound();
        edge = edges[edgeId_];
        edge.acknowledged = acknowledged_;

        if (acknowledged_) {
            emit EdgeAcknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
        } else {
            emit EdgeUnacknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the acknowledgment status of the edge is updated in storage by directly modifying the state variable representing the edge
