# Edge Acknowledgment Status Not Persisted in Storage

## Summary

The `_setAcknowledged` function does not correctly update the persistent storage for edge acknowledgment statuses in the `TitlesGraph` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function intended to update the acknowledgment status of an edge fails to write these changes back to the contractâ€™s storage, affecting the integrity of graph data management.

## Impact

This is a medium severity issue because it causes the acknowledgment status of edges to not reflect actual updates, potentially leading to incorrect data usage and impacting system integrity.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L195-L213

```solidity
function _setAcknowledged(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bool acknowledged_)
    internal
    returns (Edge memory edge)
{
    if (!_edgeIds.contains(edgeId_)) revert NotFound();
    edge = edges[edgeId_];
    edge.acknowledged = acknowledged_;

    if (acknowledged_) {
        emit EdgeAcknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
    } else {
        emit EdgeUnacknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure the acknowledgment changes are stored by updating the `edges` mapping at the end of `_setAcknowledged` function:

```solidity
edges[edgeId_].acknowledged = acknowledged_;
edge = edges[edgeId_];
```
