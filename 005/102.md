# TitlesGraph._setAcknowledged() does not acknowledge an edge

## Summary

The function `TitlesGraph._setAcknowledged()` fails to set the `acknowledged` value of an edge to `true` as it uses memory instead of storage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `_setAcknowledged()` defines a memory value in the `returns` statement `Edge memory edge`. It then loads into memory the value of the edge pointed by `edgeId_` and modify the memory value to acknowledge. This does not update the value in storage which will remain at its value before the function was called (`false` all the time since no other function modifies it).

```solidity
    function _setAcknowledged(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bool acknowledged_)
        internal
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        if (!_edgeIds.contains(edgeId_)) revert NotFound();
        edge = edges[edgeId_];
        edge.acknowledged = acknowledged_;  //Â @audit does not impact storage

        if (acknowledged_) {
            emit EdgeAcknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
        } else {
            emit EdgeUnacknowledged(edge, msg.sender, data_);
        }
    }
```

## Impact

The protocol team proposes this `TitlesGraph` contract as an example to implement the `OpenGraph` standard they propose. Anyone could expend and build on top of this Graph implementation (including the protocol team) and read wrong values for the public mapping `mapping(bytes32 id => Edge edge) public edges;`

A core value of the protocol (Graph edge acknowledgement) is incorrect.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set the acknowledged value in storage using: `edges[edgeId_].acknowledged = acknowledged_` instead of loading into memory.
