# `TitlesGraph.sol::acknowledgeEdge`  and `TitlesGraph.sol::unacknowledgeEdge` don't update the `edge.acknowledged` storage correctly

## Summary
As @pqseags pointed out in the discord channel, the acknowledgeEdge system is meant to endorse others creators work:
"
1. User1 trains an AI model (offchain) on a collection that they published (collectionA, modelA)
2. User2 uses modelA to create a new work of media (workB)
3. User2 publishes workB in a new Edition collection (collectionB / EditionB)
4. Because workB uses modelA to sample collectionA, a new reference is created in the TitlesGraph from workB to collectionA.
5. Because workB uses modelA to sample collectionA and user1 created collectionA, user1 is added as an attribution address
6. When collectors mint workB, proceeds are split between user2and user1.
7. Since user1 is the creator of referenced collectionA, if they like workB and want to endorse it, they can choose to acknowledge the reference."

## Vulnerability Detail
Although the `TitlesGraph.sol::_setAcknowledged` is getting the `TitlesGraph.sol::edges` from storage correctly, the initiated `edge = edges[edgeId_]` variable is on the `memory` as shows the return declaration `Edge memory edge`. So, the update lasts until the end of the function and is not reflected in the storage as expected.

## Impact
- `TitlesGraph.sol::_setAcknowledged` emits an event transmitting wrong information for whatever system is listening to it.
- The `edges` mapping will never reflect the correct status of acknowledgment, breaking the functionality completely, and making all the functions that try to update this particular variable useless.

        if (acknowledged_) {
