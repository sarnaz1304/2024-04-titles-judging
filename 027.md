# FeeMananger is not upgradable, which will make deployed Editions unable to move to planned cross-chain functionality

## Summary

Within the comments in `FeeManager` there are many mentions about this current version of the `FeeMananger` not currently supporting cross chain payments. The protocol aims to enable cross chain fees in the future, meaning `Editions` deployed in the meantime will never be able to have their `FeeMananger` implementation to be upgraded due to there being no way to change `FEE_MANANGER`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The comments within `FeeMananger` mention that cross-chain payouts are not **currently** supported:

[FeeManager.sol#L475](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L475)
```solidity
    /// @dev Note that cross-chain payouts are not currently supported. Rather than reverting, this function assumes that the creator and attributions are on the same network.
    function _buildSharesAndTargets(
        Target memory creator,
        Target[] memory attributions,
        uint32 revshareBps
    ) internal pure returns (address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory shares) {
```
The protocol is planning to become cross-chain compatible to allow for fees to be sent between different supported chains such as:
> On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
> Ethereum, Base, OP, Zora, Blast, Arbitrum, zkSync, Degen

`TitlesCore` is upgradable, meanining in the future it will be possible for new `Editions` deployed by the new version of `TitleCore` to have a different implementation of `FeeManager`:
[TitlesCore.sol#L32](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol#L32)
```solidity
contract TitlesCore is OwnableRoles, Initializable, UUPSUpgradeable, Receiver {
```

However `Edition` contracts are not upgradable and do not have any setter function to allow for the changing of `FeeMananger` in the future:
[Edition.sol#L36](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L36)
```solidity
contract Edition is IEdition, ERC1155, ERC2981, Initializable, OwnableRoles {
```

## Impact

Planned protocol upgrades to support cross-chain fees will be incompatible with `Edition`s created within the mean time, meaning `Edition` will either have limited functionality compared to newer `Edition`s or they will have to be redeployed which will cause many issues in the future.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that `Edition.sol` contains a way to change FEE_MANAGER to allow `Edition`s to be future proof to allow for smooth transititions to the protocol cross-chain plans.
