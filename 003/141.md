# TitlesCore `editionImplementation` will not be initialized correctly

## Summary
[TitlesCore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol) is an upgradable smart contract which sets one of its storage variables during deployment. This will result in that same variable not being initialized in the Proxy contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the `TitlesCore` implementation is deployed, an instance of `Edition` is also deployed and saved in `editionImplementation`.
```solidity
    address public editionImplementation = address(new Edition());
```
The problem is that this storage variable will not be initialized in the actual proxy.

## Impact
`editionImplementation` will be `address(0)` and calls to it will fail.
## Code Snippet

Also, a PoC to put in [TitlesCore.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/test/TitlesCore.t.sol)
```solidity
    function testProxy() public {
        TitlesCore proxyContract = TitlesCore(payable(address(new ERC1967Proxy(address(titlesCore), ""))));
        proxyContract.initialize(address(1), address(new MockSplitFactory()));

        assertEq(proxyContract.editionImplementation(), address(0));
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The variable may be initialized in the `initialize` function instead
