# graph in TitlesCore can not be upgraded

## Summary
TitlesGraph is UUPSUpgradeable, which means that it is designed to be upgradeable. But the way how TitlesCore new it makes it unupgradeable.

## Vulnerability Detail
In TitlesCore, `graph = new TitlesGraph(address(this), msg.sender);`
```solidity
    function initialize(address feeReceiver_, address splitFactory_) external initializer {
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);

        feeManager = new FeeManager(msg.sender, feeReceiver_, splitFactory_);
        graph = new TitlesGraph(address(this), msg.sender);
    }
```
Then graph is Instance contract but proxy contract, which means it is unupgradeable.

## Impact
graph in TitlesCore is unupgradeable.
