# Works with multiple attributions will result in royalty payments only for the first attribution

## Summary

Works with multiple attributions will result in royalty payments only for the first attribution.

## Vulnerability Detail

When users publish a work through `TitlesCore.publish()` they can set multiples attributions (up to 255) and a royalty target, which is used "to signal a royalty amount to be paid to the NFT creator or rights holder every time the NFT is sold or re-sold" according to the [EIP-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981).

However, the royalty target for the given work is set based only on the first attribution in `work_.attributions`, despite multiple attributions being entitled to royalties.

```solidity
    function _publish(Edition edition_, WorkPayload memory work_, address referrer_)
        internal
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        // Publish the new Work in the Edition
        tokenId = edition_.publish(
            work_.creator.target,
            work_.maxSupply,
            work_.opensAt,
            work_.closesAt,
❌          work_.attributions, //@audit User can set multiple attributions here
            work_.strategy,
            work_.metadata
        );

        // Collect the creation fee
        feeManager.collectCreationFee{value: msg.value}(edition_, tokenId, msg.sender);

        // Create the fee route for the new Work
        //@audit createRoute() returns a Target feeReceiver from only the first attribution
❌      Target memory feeReceiver = feeManager.createRoute(
            edition_, tokenId, _attributionTargets(work_.attributions), referrer_
        );

        // Set the royalty target for the new Work
        //@audit Incorrectly sets the royalty target for only the first attribution
❌      edition_.setRoyaltyTarget(tokenId, feeReceiver.target);
    }
```

## Impact

Loss of royalties for all attributions except the first one.

## Recommendation

Consider splitting royalties evenly across all attributions.
