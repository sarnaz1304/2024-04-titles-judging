# FeeManager ignores and overrides strategy asset when collection mint fee

## Summary

The protocol uses ETH to handle all fees and payments, however it fails to validate the strategy's asset when a new Work is published, leading to potential discrepancies about its price.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a new Work is published, the publisher is allowed to specify an Strategy that contains the mint fee as well as the asset to be used when collecting the fee.

```solidity
/// @notice Strategy represents a fee strategy.
/// @param asset The address of the asset to be used for fees.
/// @param mintFee The fee for minting an asset (in wei).
/// @param revshareBps The royalty revshare (in basis points).
/// @param royaltyBps The ERC2981 secondary sales royalty fee (in basis points).
/// @dev The royalty revshare is a percentage of the collected mint fee that is paid to attributed creators. It is expressed in basis points (1/100th of a percent). For example, a 100 bps (1%) royalty fee on a 1 ETH mint fee would result in a 0.01 ETH royalty fee.
struct Strategy {
    address asset;
    uint112 mintFee;
    uint16 revshareBps;
    uint16 royaltyBps;
}
```

When the FeeManager collects the minting fee, the `asset` parameter is ignored and overridden for the ETH constant.

Edition:

```solidity
    function mintFee(uint256 tokenId_, uint256 amount_) public view returns (uint256) {
        if (tokenId_ == 0 || tokenId_ > totalWorks) return 0;
        // @audit ignores strategy asset
@>      return FEE_MANAGER.getMintFee(works[tokenId_].strategy, amount_).amount;
    }
```

FeeManager:

```solidity
    function getMintFee(Strategy memory strategy_, uint256 quantity_)
        public
        view
        returns (Fee memory fee)
    {
        // Return the total fee (creator's mint fee + protocol flat fee)
        // @audit asset is overridden here for ETH
@>      return Fee({asset: ETH_ADDRESS, amount: quantity_ * (strategy_.mintFee + protocolFlatFee)});
    }
```

Failing to validate the strategy's asset when a new work is published, and silently overriding the asset with ETH, will lead to price discrepancies. This is because the desired amount magnitude could be significantly different from the final mint amount that is effectively charged.

## Impact

Work publishers are allowed to specify the mint fee amount in an asset of their choice. However, overriding the specified asset with ETH could create significant discrepancies between the expected amount to be collected and the final amount collected when minting their work. Since different assets have dissimilar prices compared to ETH, the intended amount magnitude specified by the publisher will likely lead to considerable differences in the final collected price.

For example, if the original publisher's intention is to use BTC as the asset, the specified amount would be off by 95% taking prices at the moment of writing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`validateStrategy()` should check that the given asset is `ETH_ADDRESS`, and revert with an informative error if not.
