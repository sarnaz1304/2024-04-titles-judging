# Incorrect `asset` address used in mint fee calculation in `FeeManager::getMintFee`

## Summary

Incorrect `asset` address used in mint fee calculation in `FeeManager::getMintFee` causes all minting operations to require native Ether

## Vulnerability Detail

The `FeeManager::getMintFee` function is designed to calculate the minting fee based on a given strategy and the quantity of tokens being minted. However, the function incorrectly hardcodes the asset type to `ETH_ADDRESS` instead of using the asset type specified in the strategy (`strategy_.asset`). This results in the mint fee being calculated in Ether regardless of the actual asset type defined in the strategy.

## Impact

This issue reduces protocol's flexibility and leads to all minting operations requiring Ether to cover the expenses, even though the creator might've specified a different fee strategy via `Edition::setFeeStrategy`, causing mints to either revert, due to lack of Ether, or worse, ask for less funds than proposed by the creator, due to discrepancies between token amounts and Ether amounts e.g. `1e18 WBTC >> 1e18 ETH`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use address of the desired asset as defined in the `strategy` field for the specified `tokenId` of the `Edition`

```diff
    function getMintFee(Strategy memory strategy_, uint256 quantity_)
        public
        view
        returns (Fee memory fee)
    {
        // Return the total fee (creator's mint fee + protocol flat fee)
-        return Fee({asset: ETH_ADDRESS, amount: quantity_ * (strategy_.mintFee + protocolFlatFee)});
+        return Fee({asset: strategy_.asset, amount: quantity_ * (strategy_.mintFee + protocolFlatFee)});
    }
```
