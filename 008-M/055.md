# A malicious user can DoS the `acknowledgeEdge` and `unacknowledgeEdge` function by front-running

## Summary
Permanent, low cost DoS of the signature flow of `acknowledgeEdge` and `unacknowledgeEdge` due to same signature being usable for multiple different functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The same signature can be passed in to `acknowledgeEdge` and `unacknowledgeEdge`, to act as proof that the node's address intends to acknowledge an edge.

This means that when someone calls `acknowledgeEdge(... , ... , signature)`, a front-runner can use that same signature and call `unacknowledgeEdge(... , ... , signature)` to use up that signature. 

This would cause the original user's function call to revert since `_isUsed[keccak256(signature)] == true`

This works the opposite way too- a malicious actor can frontrun any call of  `unacknowledgeEdge(... , ... , signature)` by calling `acknowledgeEdge()` with the observed signature, and this would prevent the edge from being unacknowledged by the original user. 

## Impact
At no cost, a malicious actor can cause the signature flows of `acknowledgeEdge` and `unacknowledgeEdge` functions to revert every time, this is a DoS of key protocol functionality.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
**Consider one of the following solutions:**
1. Include the intention of the signature within the digest (for example a boolean true or false to represent `acknowledgeEdge` vs `unacknowledgeEdge`. 
2. Cause `unacknowledgeEdge` to revert if the edge is already not acknowledged, and vice versa.
