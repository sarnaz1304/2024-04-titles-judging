# Signature malleability- anyone can acknowledge or unacknowledge an edge from someone else's node

## Summary
The signatures used within the `TitlesGraph` contract are malleable. This allows a malicious actor to craft a different signature which recovers to the same signer address, allowing the malicious actor to call `acknowledgeEdge()` or `unacknowledgeEdge()` when not intended by the actual signer.

## Vulnerability Detail
The library being used to check signatures is `SignatureCheckerLib` from solady. The following warnings are provided:

```solidity
/// WARNING! Do NOT use signatures as unique identifiers:
                                     ...
/// This implementation does NOT check if a signature is non-malleable.
```

Since the library does not check that a signature is non-malleable, a malicious actor can forge an alternate signature that still resolves to the original signer. 

This would allow them to bypass the uniqueness checks used in the `checkSignature()` modifier, and be able to call `acknowledgeEdge()` or `unacknowledgeEdge()` on their own terms, unintended by the actual signer.

## Impact
Anybody can `acknowledgeEdge` or `unacknowledgeEdge` even though they are not the target address of the `from` node.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
**There are 2 options:** Either require a nonce for each signature, or use OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library to safeguard against signature malleability attacks.
