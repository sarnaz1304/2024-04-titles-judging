# Signature malleability breaks TitlesGraph.sol

## Summary
There are 2 versions of signatures from the same data. Because of that property it is advised to not use signature as unique identificator.
You can read here https://detectors.auditbase.com/signature-malleability-of-evms-ecrecover

## Vulnerability Detail
Here you can see that signature is used as unique identifier of performed action. So attacker can use another version of used signature to maliciously perform opposite action. For example if edge was previously acknowledged, then he can unacknowledge it.
```solidity
    modifier checkSignature(bytes32 edgeId, bytes calldata data, bytes calldata signature) {
        bytes32 digest = _hashTypedData(keccak256(abi.encode(ACK_TYPEHASH, edgeId, data)));
        if (
            !edges[edgeId].to.creator.target.isValidSignatureNowCalldata(digest, signature)
                || _isUsed[keccak256(signature)]
        ) {
            revert Unauthorized();
        }
        _;
@>      _isUsed[keccak256(signature)] = true;
    }

    function acknowledgeEdge(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bytes calldata signature_)
        external
@>      checkSignature(edgeId_, data_, signature_)
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        return _setAcknowledged(edgeId_, data_, true);
    }

    function unacknowledgeEdge(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_, bytes calldata signature_)
        external
@>      checkSignature(edgeId_, data_, signature_)
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        return _setAcknowledged(edgeId_, data_, false);
    }
```

## Impact
Attacker can use another version of used signature to maliciously perform opposite action. For example if edge was previously acknowledged, then he can unacknowledge it.
