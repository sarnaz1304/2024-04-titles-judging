# A malicious receiver can drain the excess funds in `Edition` during minting

## Summary

A malicious receiver can steal excess funds in `Edition` through reentrancy.

## Vulnerability Detail

Due to ERC-1155 callbacks and the fact that the `Edition` contract sends back the remaining ETH balance, a receiver can drain the excess funds of ETH when a legit user calls a minting function.

This is a reentrancy issue.

## Impact

Legit user can lose funds.

## Code Snippet

The [`mint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L228-L242), [`mintWithComment`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L252-L270) and the [two](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L277-L297) [`mintBatch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L304-L320) functions are all payable and refund the excessive ETH balance to `msg.sender`.
In this section, only the `mint` function is shown but all these functions are vulnerable.

The [`mint` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L228-L242) mints the ERC-1155 token through `_issue` which will calls the `to_` address to comply with ERC-1155 standard.

A malicious `_to` address can callback the `mint` function to call `_refundExcess` before the first transaction does.

```solidity
    function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        // ...

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);// @POC: ERC-1155 callbacks `to_`
        _refundExcess();// @POC: refund to `msg.sender`
    }

    /// @notice Refund any excess ETH sent to the contract.
    /// @dev This function is called after minting tokens to refund any ETH left in the contract after all fees have been collected.
    function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```

A malicious receiver can reenter one of the minting functions to drain ETH funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a `nonReentrant` modifier on minting functions.
