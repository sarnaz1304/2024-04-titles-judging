# `msg.sender` is not correctly transmited in external calls, blocking users from minting NFTs through `Edition.sol::mint`

## Summary
On interacting with external contracts, the caller becomes a new `msg.sender` instead of the original caller.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling `Edition.sol::mint`, the original `msg.sender` is changed when the function calls `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee` will be charged from the `FEE_MANAGER` contract and not from the `user` as expected.

## Impact
If the `FEE_MANAGER` doesn't hold any eth as expected, the call will never go through.

          // vm.deal(address(manager), 10 ether);
  
          vm.prank(BARBA);
          edition.mint(BARBA, 1, 1, mintReferrer, "");
