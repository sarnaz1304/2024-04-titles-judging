# The Tiles protocol does not support the payment in ERC20 tokens

## Summary

Contrary to the description of the protocol, payment assets different than `ETH` won't be taken into account.

## Vulnerability Detail

When minting a token, the `collectMintFee` function from the `FeeManager` contract collects the fees from the user. During this process the `getMintFee` function is invoked to retrieve a `Fee` structure that contains the assets' address used to pay and the amount of this token needed to perform the minting. 

The problem is that the returned `Fee` object has its address attribute set to the hardcoded value of the `ETH` asset instead of retrieving the `asset` attribute of the `Strategy` object assigned to the current work.
 

## Impact

There are multiple impacts:
- medium one: It is not possible to use other assets than `ETH` to pay a minting;
- high one: if a creator publishes a new work with a fee strategy based on an `ERC20`  that is a lot less worth than ETH; when a user tries to mint a token from this work, he will instead pay the minting with `ETH` (this could happen if the frontend generates a transaction that requests to send the amount in `msg.value`). 

## Code Snippet

- Every minting function makes a call to the `collectMintFee` function passing the specific fee strategy of the work:

- This function calls the `getMintFee` functions to retrieve the `Fee` structure

- The `getMintFee` function hardcodes the `ETH` constant value as asset instead of using the strategy's `asset` attribute

- This wrong `Fee` structure is then used to collect the funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `getMintFee` function should fill the `asset` attribute of the `Fee` structure with the `asset` address of the `Strategy` structure.
