# Work attributions cannot be changed

## Summary

When a fee payment route is created, the admin sets the receiver of the fees. That receiver may be a SplitWallet, where the creator of the work and several attributions split the received fees:

```solidity
receiver = Target({
    target: splitFactory.createSplit(
        SplitV2Lib.Split({
            recipients: targets,
            allocations: revshares,
            totalAllocation: 1e6,
            distributionIncentive: 0
        }),
        address(this),
        creator.target
        ),
    chainId: creator.chainId
});
```

SplitWallet allows attributions to be changed by the owner of the split. The issue is that, as the owner of created SplitWallets is always set to the FeeManager address, attributions cannot be updated.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the case that a work creator decides that some attribution addresses must be removed or others must be added to receive mint fees, they would not be able to do so as the FeeManager contract, set as the owner of the SplitWallet, does not implement any functions that call SplitWalletV2's `updateSplit` function. This may be especially problematic in the case that an attribution turns malicious and must be prevented from receiving any fees.

## Impact

Fees may be wrongly distributed.

## Recommendation

Implement a function in FeeManager that enables updating attributions.
