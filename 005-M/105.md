# TitlesGraph's `checkSignature()` does not properly check replayability

## Summary

The modifier to check a user's signature `checkSignature()` does not properly enforce non-malleability / replayability of signatures.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function attempts to prevent replaying signatures by using a mapping from bytes to boolean `_isUsed[keccak256(signature)]`: 

```solidity
    modifier checkSignature(bytes32 edgeId, bytes calldata data, bytes calldata signature) {
        bytes32 digest = _hashTypedData(keccak256(abi.encode(ACK_TYPEHASH, edgeId, data)));
        if (
            !edges[edgeId].to.creator.target.isValidSignatureNowCalldata(digest, signature)
                || _isUsed[keccak256(signature)]  // @audit insufficient for non-replayability and does not check non-malleability
        ) {
            revert Unauthorized();
        }
        _;
        _isUsed[keccak256(signature)] = true;
    }
```

This is intended to prevent a single signature produced by a signer to be used multiple times by a caller. However the library used for verifying the signature is not strict enough on the expected signature format and uses the `ecrecover` precompile which is notoriously vulnerable to malleability.

Anyone can observe a valid signature for `checkSignature()` and produce a different valid signature (with a different hash) for the same data. As such, the `_isUsed` mapping is insufficient to prevent non-replayability of signatures.

The used library even warns about this:

```solidity
/// @dev Note:
/// - The signature checking functions use the ecrecover precompile (0x1).
/// - The `bytes memory signature` variants use the identity precompile (0x4)
///   to copy memory internally.
/// - Unlike ECDSA signatures, contract signatures are revocable.
/// - As of Solady version 0.0.134, all `bytes signature` variants accept both
///   regular 65-byte `(r, s, v)` and EIP-2098 `(r, vs)` short form signatures.
///   See: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2098
///   This is for calldata efficiency on smart accounts prevalent on L2s.
///
/// WARNING! Do NOT use signatures as unique identifiers:
/// - Use a nonce in the digest to prevent replay attacks on the same contract.
/// - Use EIP-712 for the digest to prevent replay attacks across different chains and contracts.
///   EIP-712 also enables readable signing of typed data for better user safety.
/// This implementation does NOT check if a signature is non-malleable.
library SignatureCheckerLib { ... }
```

And it is obvious when reading the code of the library that it allows different format of signatures and calls the precompile at `address(1)` (ecrecover).

## Impact

The modifier `checkSignature()` can be tricked and signatures can be replayed to pass its check. Currently this modifier is used to protect `acknowledgeEdge()` and `unacknowledgeEdge()` functions. As such, a creator that acknowledges an edge using a signature and later unacknowledges the edge can be abused by anyone acknowledging the edge once again in their name by replaying their signature.

If this modifier is later used on other functions, it could have critical consequences.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This feature of acknowledging and edge via signature does not seem vital and could be deleted. Otherwise, enforce strict requirements on the signature or use a hash of the signed data in the `_isUsed` mapping instead of a hash of the signature. Signers will have to use different data to replay their intent.
