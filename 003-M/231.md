# `TitlesCore.createEdition()` will keep reverting until the admin's intervention due to an incomplete initialization

## Summary

The `editionImplementation` variable is set on the implementation contract but isn't initialized in `initialize()`.
Due to the call to `editionImplementation.clone()` in `createEdition()`, this function will revert until the owner or the admin's intervention.

## Vulnerability Detail

We can see that `editionImplementation` is created on the proxy ([TitlesCore.sol#L37](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol#L37)) and will most likely be the implementation which will be cloned in subsequent Edition creation:

```solidity
File: TitlesCore.sol
37:     address public editionImplementation = address(new Edition());
```

However, this value is neither set in `TitlesCore`'s proxy not initialized in `initialize` ([TitlesCore.sol#L44-L49](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol#L44-L49)):

```solidity
File: TitlesCore.sol
44:     function initialize(address feeReceiver_, address splitFactory_) external initializer {
45:         _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
46: 
47:         feeManager = new FeeManager(msg.sender, feeReceiver_, splitFactory_); 
48:         graph = new TitlesGraph(address(this), msg.sender);
49:     }
```

This means that, the following call will revert until the admin or the owner's intervention ([TitlesCore.sol#L79](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol#L79)):

```solidity
File: TitlesCore.sol
79:         edition = Edition(editionImplementation.clone());
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `editionImplementation` in `initialize()`.
While it could be argued that the deployment script could be calling `setEditionImplementation()`, its omission in `initialize()` actually gives credit to the likelihood of this Denial of Service. Also, the currently available file is empty ([Titles.s.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/script/Titles.s.sol))
