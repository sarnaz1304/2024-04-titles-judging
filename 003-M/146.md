# Owner and admin roles in TitlesGraph are not initialized

## Summary

The `TitlesGraph` contract is intended to be upgradable. However, the owner and admin roles are assigned within the constructor. This implies that they will be initialized in the implementation storage, leaving the proxy storage unaffected.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
constructor(address owner_, address admin_) {
    _initializeOwner(owner_);
    _grantRoles(admin_, ADMIN_ROLE);
}
```

## Impact

Neither the owner nor the admin of the `TitlesGraph` contract has the ability to manage it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Assign owner and admin roles within an initialization function.
