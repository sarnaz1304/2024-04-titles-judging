# TitlesCore and TitlesGraph are  UUPSUpgradeable but lacks _disableInitializers to disable initializer in implementation

## Summary
TitlesCore and TitlesGraph are  UUPSUpgradeable but lacks _disableInitializers to disable initializer in implementation when it is deployed

## Vulnerability Detail
An uninitialized implementetion  after deployement can have a serious effect if an attacker should become the owner of the implementation which he can selfdestruct the implementation using upgradeandcall to address with selfdestruct opcode which will rander the proxy useless.
from OZ cuation
  Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 Asked the protocol team which he believe is a valid issue
 
## Impact
Halting of protocol functionality and funds loss if at the time it has funds

## Recommendation
Add  to TitlesCore and TitlesGraph
```solidity
  constructor() {
     _disableInitializers();
  }
  ```
