# No Protection of Uninitialized Implementation Contracts From Attacker

## Summary
Missing `_disableInitializers` function in the constructor to prevent the implementation contract from being used by the attacker.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the contracts implement Openzeppelin’s UUPS model, uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker with initialize function, it’s recommended to invoke the `_disableInitializers` function in the constructor to prevent the implementation contract from being used by the attacker. 
## Impact
Attacker can call the initialize function and set variable values of his choice which would cause the attacker to even steal funds.
