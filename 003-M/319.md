# The `TitlesGraph` contract doesn't have an external initializer

## Summary
The TitlesGraph contract inherits from the UUPSUpgradeable contract but lacks an external initializer function. Additionally, it contains a constructor, making it vulnerable.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L17
```solidity
    contract TitlesGraph is IOpenGraph, IEdgeManager, OwnableRoles, EIP712, UUPSUpgradeable {
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L52
```solidity
    constructor(address owner_, address admin_) {
        _initializeOwner(owner_);
        _grantRoles(admin_, ADMIN_ROLE);
    }
```

## Impact
Proxied contract can't have a constructor and it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called initialize
Without the `initializer` modifier, there is a risk that the initialization function can be called multiple times.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L52
```solidity
    constructor(address owner_, address admin_) {
        _initializeOwner(owner_);
        _grantRoles(admin_, ADMIN_ROLE);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use initializer functions for initialization of proxied contracts and use the `initializer` modifier for initialization functions
