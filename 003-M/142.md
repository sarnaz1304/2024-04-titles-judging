# TitleGraph cannot be upgraded

## Summary

The `TitleGraph` contract is intended to be upgradable; however, it is instantiated within the `TitlesCore::initialize` function without utilizing any proxy mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `TitleGraph` contract inherits from `UUPSUpgradeable` and implements the `_authorizeUpgrade` function. I have also consulted with the protocol team to confirm whether the contract is supposed to be upgradable, and they have confirmed this to be the case.

Despite this, the contract instance is created without employing an upgradeable proxy.

## Impact

The `TitleGraph` contract cannot be upgraded.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `TitleGraph` implementation should be created behind a proxy.
