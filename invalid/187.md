# `Edition::mintBatch` receives less money than it should.

## Summary

`Edition::mintBatch` only receives the price for one buyer.

## Vulnerability Detail

As seen at `L312` of `Edition::mintBatch`, it receives only the price for one buyer. In fact, it should receive the price for all receivers.

```solidity
    function mintBatch(
        address[] calldata receivers_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
312         this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        }

        _refundExcess();
    }
```

## Impact

The protocol and publishers incur a loss when selling to several receivers at once.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`Edition::mintBatch` should be fixed as follows.

```diff
    function mintBatch(
        address[] calldata receivers_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
-           this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
+           this, tokenId_, amount_ * receivers_.length, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        }

        _refundExcess();
    }
```
