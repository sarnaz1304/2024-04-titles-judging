# Unprotected Token Metadata Update

## Summary

The `setMetadata` function is not well protected.

## Vulnerability Detail

In edition.sol, `setMetadata` function allows the contract owner to alter the metadata of any token ID including tokens belonging to other users which is potentially harmful for the token owners. 

## Impact

An adequate permission system is not set, and it does give excessive power to the contract owner to change metadata of any token.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L376-L384

```solidity
/// @notice Set the metadata for a given ID.
/// @param id_ The ID of the work, or `0` for the Edition
/// @param metadata_ The new metadata.
function setMetadata(uint256 id_, Metadata calldata metadata_) external {
    // Only the owner can update the Edition metadata
    if (id_ == 0 && msg.sender != owner()) revert Unauthorized();
    // Only the creator can update the work metadata
    if (id_ > 0 && msg.sender != works[id_].creator) revert Unauthorized();
    _metadata[id_] = metadata_;
}
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is strongly advisable to provide stricter restrictions on who can update metadata to avoid any form of malicious activity. You could change the design to only allow for token creators to modify their own token metadata, or better yet, make token metadata immutable after it has been set.
