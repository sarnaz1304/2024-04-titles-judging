# wrong usage of UUPSUpgradeable leads to non-upgradeable

## Summary
wrong usage of UUPSUpgradeable

## Vulnerability Detail
TitlesGraph is an UUPSUpgradeable contract, and the admin said it will be an upgradeable contract. However, when using TitlesGraph, it directly use new rather than proxy, which will leads to non-upgradeable.

The upgrade function ``upgradeToAndCall`` can only be called by proxy. https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol#L81

```solidity
contract TitlesGraph is IOpenGraph, IEdgeManager, OwnableRoles, EIP712, UUPSUpgradeable {

function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes calldata data)
        public
        payable
        virtual
        onlyProxy

/// @dev Requires that the execution is performed through a proxy.
    modifier onlyProxy() {
        uint256 s = __self;
        /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
        assembly {
            // To enable use cases with an immutable default implementation in the bytecode,
            // (see: ERC6551Proxy), we don't require that the proxy address must match the
            // value stored in the implementation slot, which may not be initialized.
            if eq(s, address()) {
                mstore(0x00, 0x9f03a026) // `UnauthorizedCallContext()`.
                revert(0x1c, 0x04)
            }
        }
        _;
    }
```
