# No funds can be refunded

## Summary

When a work token is minted, the caller supplies ETH to pay for the mint fees. Any excess funds are intended to be refunded to the `msg.sender` through the `_refundExcess` function. The issue is that no funds will ever be refunded.

## Vulnerability Detail

`_refundExcess` sends any remaining ETH in the Edition.sol smart contract to the caller, aiming to refund any of the `msg.value`, that has not been used to cover the mint fees. The issue is that when `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}` is called, all of the `msg.value` is transferred to the `FEE_MANAGER`, and any ETH, that is left over after the fees are paid, is not sent back to the Edition.sol contract, but remains stuck in the FeeManager.sol contract:

```solidity
FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
    this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
);
```

Consequently, when `_refundExcess` is called only ETH left in the Edition.sol contract balance is sent to the initial caller, which in most cases will be close to or equal to 0.

Furthermore, as the remaining  `msg.value` (that was not used for fee payments) is stuck in the FeeManager.sol contract, any other user can send it to the `protocolFeeReceiver`(if it is sufficient enough) by calling `collectCreationFee`. This will prevent the admin from getting the stuck refund through `withdraw`, and sending it back to the initial caller.

## Impact

Loss of funds for minters.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Unused funds in `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee` should be sent back from the FeeManager.sol contract to the Edition.sol contract, in order for the refund functionality to work. Another soution would be to calculate the amount of fees that the mint is going to cost and provide only that amount in `FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee`, instead of the entire `msg.value`.
