# Inconsistent Edge ID Generation after Work Transfer

## Summary

Transferring a work in the `Edition` contract leads to discrepancies in edge ID generation, causing issues with subsequent operations on edges like acknowledgment or unacknowledgment.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `transferWork` function in the Edition contract updates the creator of a work, which alters the return value of `node(uint256 tokenId)`. Since edge IDs are generated based on node information, changes to the node affect the consistency of edge IDs. This discrepancy means that after a work is transferred, the previously generated edge IDs no longer correspond accurately to their associated nodes, preventing the correct execution of functions that rely on these IDs.

## Impact

This is a medium severity issue as it disrupts the functionality of acknowledging or unacknowledging edges after a work transfer. 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L412-L420

```solidity
function transferWork(address to_, uint256 tokenId_) external {
    Work storage work = works[tokenId_];
    if (msg.sender != work.creator) revert Unauthorized();

    // Transfer the work to the new creator
    work.creator = to_;

    emit WorkTransferred(address(this), tokenId_, to_);
}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L197-L204

```solidity
    function node(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (Node memory) {
        return Node({
            nodeType: NodeType.TOKEN_ERC1155,
            creator: Target({target: works[tokenId].creator, chainId: block.chainid}),
            entity: Target({target: address(this), chainId: block.chainid}),
            data: abi.encode(tokenId)
        });
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/interfaces/IEdgeManager.sol#L22-L36

```solidity
    /// @notice Acknowledges an {Edge} with the given data.
    /// @param edgeId_ The ID of the {Edge} to acknowledge.
    /// @param data_ The data associated with the acknowledgment.
    /// @return edge The acknowledged {Edge}.
    function acknowledgeEdge(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_)
        external
        returns (Edge memory edge);

    /// @notice Unacknowledges an {Edge} with the given data.
    /// @param edgeId_ The ID of the {Edge} to unacknowledge.
    /// @param data_ The data associated with the unacknowledgment.
    /// @return edge The unacknowledged {Edge}.
    function unacknowledgeEdge(bytes32 edgeId_, bytes calldata data_)
        external
        returns (Edge memory edge);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider updating the edge ID generation logic to be less dependent on mutable attributes or explicitly handle edge ID updates when works are transferred.
