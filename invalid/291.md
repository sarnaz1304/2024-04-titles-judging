# mintBatch mints more tokens than the amount on which the fees was applied.

## Summary
Fees is applied on the amount of tokens a user requests to mint but there is Discrepancy between the tokens on which the fees was applied and total tokens that are minted.

## Vulnerability Detail
Following is mintBatch function 
```solidity
function mintBatch(
        address[] calldata receivers_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        }

        _refundExcess();
    }
```
From above it is clear that fee is applied only on amount number of tokens.
But when the for loop is executed it issues each receiver tokens = amount number of tokens essentially total tokens minted are = number of receivers*amount whereas the fees was only collected for amount number of tokens thus allowing minting of excess tokens without paying any fee.
## Impact
A user can mint tokens by paying only very less fee than they should because number of receivers can be any number(even same user as every array element).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
make the following change in the code
```solidity
--- for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        }
+++  for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_/(receivers_.length) , data_);
        }
```
