# Incorrect `mintBatch()` logic lets users bypass paying most of the fees

## Summary
Incorrect `mintBatch()` logic lets users pay way less fees than they are supposed to.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Edition.sol`'s [MintBatch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L304) function issues `amount_` of tokens to every address specified in `address[] receivers_`, but calls FeeManager to collect fees needed to mint `amount_` of tokens for only one address. This leads to users being able to mint for multiple addresses while paying for just one.
```solidity
function mintBatch(
        address[] calldata receivers_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable {
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
+           this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
        }

        _refundExcess();
    }
```

## Impact
Protocol and creators won't get most of the fees because any users can mint to multiple addresses they own and paying much smaller amounts than they should.

## Recommendation

Take fees for every address provided.
```solidity
FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
+           this, tokenId_, amount_*receivers_.length, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
        );
```
