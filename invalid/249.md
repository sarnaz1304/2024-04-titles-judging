# Intermediate value sent by the caller can be drained via reentrancy by a malicious creator , collectionReferrer or mint referrer

## Summary
Intermediate value sent by the caller can be drained via reentrancy by a malicious creator , collectionReferrer or mint referrer from the current implementation of _refundExcess() on Edition contract
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
The current implementation of _refundExcess () sends the balance of its address to msg.sender during refund if both rules are met. 
The probems comes when sending fee to various recipients
```solidity
 _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
```
if the recipients is malicious and implents a fallback it can potentially call back to any mint  function with the exact required fee  or just 1 wei  because of the logic bug  in mints the feeManager  balance from excesses  can be used to pay for mint fee     which will trigger the _refundExcess as msg.value is greater than 0 and address(this).balance > 0 from the initial caller value . the malicious recipint gets the refund while the original caller gets nothing. 

setting this as meduim because  the mints functions contains a bug that wont allow the refund logic to trigger  as of current but this is likely to be corrected that the refunds now works then this become high.
But now since the excesses are left in the fee manager  because of logic bug is  still an issue since the call back can mint with just 1 wei if the excesses can cover the fee
