# `Edition` contract does not return excess funds when minting tokens.

## Summary

`Edition` contract does not return excess funds when minting tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Edition::mint` function claims to return excess funds after issuing the token, but the function sends the `msg.value` of the mint call to the `FeeManager` contract, by calling `FeeManager::collectMintFee` which doesn't return the excess after collecting the fees. The issue also occurs in `Edition::mintBatch`,`Edition::mintWithComment`

## Impact

Users will lose their funds if they send more than the exact minting fee.
