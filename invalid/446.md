# Strategy Royalty Bps would Go Below the Minimum Allowed

## Summary
Strategy Royalty Bps would Go Below the Minimum Allowed
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function validateStrategy(Strategy calldata strategy_)
        external
        pure
        returns (Strategy memory strategy)
    {
        // Clamp the revshare to the range of [MIN_ROYALTY_BPS...MAX_ROYALTY_BPS]
        uint16 revshareBps = strategy_.revshareBps > MAX_ROYALTY_BPS
            ? MAX_ROYALTY_BPS
            : strategy_.revshareBps < MIN_ROYALTY_BPS ? MIN_ROYALTY_BPS : strategy_.revshareBps;

        // Clamp the royalty to the range of [0...MAX_ROYALTY_BPS]
>>>        uint16 royaltyBps =
 >>>           strategy_.royaltyBps > MAX_ROYALTY_BPS ? MAX_ROYALTY_BPS : strategy_.royaltyBps;

        strategy = Strategy({
            asset: strategy_.asset == address(0) ? ETH_ADDRESS : strategy_.asset,
            mintFee: strategy_.mintFee,
            revshareBps: revshareBps,
            royaltyBps: royaltyBps
        });
    }
```
The code above shows how validateStrategy(...) function is implemented in the FeeManager contract, it can be noted in the contract that there is a maximum and minimum threshold that Strategy Royalty BPS should never cross but the problem is that the protocol is allow the Royalty value to go as low as zero without implementing the minimum threshold as done for revshareBps, the MIN_ROYALTY_BPS value as clearly written in the name shows that it is meant to handle minimum threshold for strategy royalty bps which the protocol didnt implement which would cause break protocol normal functionality
## Impact
Strategy Royalty Bps would Go Below the Minimum Allowed

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As adjusted below  strategy royalty Bps should be implemented to ensure it does not go below the minimum allowed
```solidity
 function validateStrategy(Strategy calldata strategy_)
        external
        pure
        returns (Strategy memory strategy)
    {
        // Clamp the revshare to the range of [MIN_ROYALTY_BPS...MAX_ROYALTY_BPS]
        uint16 revshareBps = strategy_.revshareBps > MAX_ROYALTY_BPS
            ? MAX_ROYALTY_BPS
            : strategy_.revshareBps < MIN_ROYALTY_BPS ? MIN_ROYALTY_BPS : strategy_.revshareBps;

        // Clamp the royalty to the range of [0...MAX_ROYALTY_BPS]
        uint16 royaltyBps =
 ---           strategy_.royaltyBps > MAX_ROYALTY_BPS ? MAX_ROYALTY_BPS : strategy_.royaltyBps;
+++           strategy_.royaltyBps > MAX_ROYALTY_BPS ? MAX_ROYALTY_BPS   : strategy_.royaltyBps < MIN_ROYALTY_BPS ? MIN_ROYALTY_BPS : strategy_.royaltyBps;

        strategy = Strategy({
            asset: strategy_.asset == address(0) ? ETH_ADDRESS : strategy_.asset,
            mintFee: strategy_.mintFee,
            revshareBps: revshareBps,
            royaltyBps: royaltyBps
        });
    }
```
