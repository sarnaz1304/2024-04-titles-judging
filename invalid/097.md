# Users can save on mint costs by setting themselves as the mint referrers, which discourages them from setting others as mint referrers

## Summary

During the minting of a work, a share of protocol fees will be distributed to the referrer of the mint. Therefore, by setting themselves as the mint referrer, users can save on mint costs. This discourages users from setting others as mint referrers.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        ...
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );
        ...
    }
```
```solidity
    function collectMintFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) external payable {
        _collectMintFee(
            edition_, tokenId_, amount_, payer_, referrer_, getMintFee(edition_, tokenId_, amount_)
        );
    }
```
```solidity
    function getMintFee(Strategy memory strategy_, uint256 quantity_)
        public
        view
        returns (Fee memory fee)
    {
        // Return the total fee (creator's mint fee + protocol flat fee)
        return Fee({asset: ETH_ADDRESS, amount: quantity_ * (strategy_.mintFee + protocolFlatFee)});
    }
```
When a user mints a work, the fee manager contract will collect at least `protocolFlatFee` from the user.

```solidity
    function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
        // The creation and mint referrers earn 25% and 50% of the protocol's share respectively, if applicable
        uint256 mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount_, referrer_);
        ...

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        ...
    }
```
Then, a share of protocol fees will be distributed to the referrer of the mint.

It means that users can spend less money on minting if they set themselves as the mint referrers. This design discourages users from assigning others as mint referrers. If users fail to set the true referrer during minting, the true referrer will not receive their share of the fee, which then discourages referrers from promoting the project to others, ultimately harming the project's visibility.

## Impact

By setting themselves as mint referrers, users can reduce their minting costs. This design discourages users from assigning others as referrers. If users fail to identify the true referrer during minting, the true referrer will not receive their share of the fee. This discourages referrers from promoting the project, ultimately reducing its visibility.

## Recommendation

Redesign the fee structure to incentivize users to provide true referrer information during minting.
