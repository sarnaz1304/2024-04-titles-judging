# incorrect implementation of refund mechanism

## Summary
_refundExcess function is implemented in edition.sol whereas edition.sol's functions are forwarding all of the msg.value to the FeeManager.sol contract. User never get the excess funds back.

## Vulnerability Detail
The _refundExcess function is currently implemented in the edition.sol. Any payable function of the edition.sol contract is forwarding all the native coin (msg.value) to FeeManager .sol contract. There is no mechanism in FeeManager.sol that returns the left over msg.value back to the edition.sol contract. there is no use of implementing _refundExcess function in the edition.sol contract.

## Impact
user will never get their excess of native coin back.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
there are ways to handle this
1. implement _refundExcess function in the FeeManager.sol
2. implement a require statement which let the users only send the msg.value equals to the amount required by the function in edition.sol contract. 
3. return the amount back to the edition contract from feeManager after processing. 
Note( the refund excess function also has a vulnerability which is submitted as a separate audit item).
