# [H-1] Arbitrary payer_ parameter in FeeManager::collectMintFee() allows any user force another user pay tokens without permission.

## Summary

Arbitrary `payer_` parameter in `FeeManager::collectMintFee()` allows any user force another user pay tokens without permission.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function `collectMintFee()` in FeeManager.sol calculates the fee to be sent to each of the actors in the protocol (referrers, feeReceivers, attribution Nodes...) and transfers those fees from `payer_`. The function in question is marked as external and `payer_` is an input parameter, thus any user can call the function with `payer_` being another user and steal their tokens, which will be sent to the receivers. No checks are made for the arbitrary `payer_` parameter.

## Impact

Impact is quite high as this vulnerability can be exploited at any time by any user in the system by just calling `FeeManager::collectMintFee()`, being `payer_` the address to be exploited.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function collectMintFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) external payable {
        _collectMintFee(
            edition_, tokenId_, amount_, payer_, referrer_, getMintFee(edition_, tokenId_, amount_)
        );
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Several mitigations can be made for this issue:

1) Make the function only callable by trusted a address, taking advantage that the contract inherits from `OwnableRoles`:

```solidity
function collectMintFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
 -    ) external payable {
 +    ) external payable onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE){
        _collectMintFee(
            edition_, tokenId_, amount_, payer_, referrer_, getMintFee(edition_, tokenId_, amount_)
        );
    }
```

2) Do not allow an arbitrary `payer_` address, being the msg.sender the one transferring their tokens to others. (It could also be made a list of payers that are eligible to pay their tokens as fees to others, but I think this is not the goal of the contract):

```solidity
function collectMintFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
 -       address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) external payable {
        _collectMintFee(
 -           edition_, tokenId_, amount_, payer_, referrer_, getMintFee(edition_, tokenId_, amount_)
 +           edition_, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, getMintFee(edition_, tokenId_, amount_)
        );
    }
```
