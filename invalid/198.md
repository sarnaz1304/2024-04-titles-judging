# Hardcoded ETH_ADDRESS could make problems on other blockchains

## Summary
The ETH address is hardcoded in the `Common.sol` contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the README.md, the protocol is going to be deployed on the following blockchains - Ethereum, Base, OP, Zora, Blast, Arbitrum, zkSync, Degen. The specific address `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE` used to represent native ETH on Ethereum may not be directly applicable or recognized as representing the native token on other EVM-compatible blockchains.

## Impact
Protocol will not work on most of the supported blockchains.

```Solidity
address constant ETH_ADDRESS = address(0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a way to not have the ETH_ADDRESS as a constant
