# During the collectMintFee the collection referrer doesn't receive any fees.

## Summary
The fee transfer works incorrectly, the collection referrer doesn't receive any fees, because his part goes to the mint referrer (arbitrary address)
## Vulnerability Detail
During the collectMintFee the collection referrer receives any fees. Mint referrer receive collection referrer fees instead. 
The main part here, that during the collectMintFee, the _splitProtocolFee is called. This function is responsible for distribute the fees between the 
1. protocolFeeReceiver
2. collection referrer
3. mint referrer
However, the function works incorrectly and sends the fees that belong to the collection referrer to the mint referrer.
```solidity
_route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
     
        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );
```
The referrer_ in our case is mintRefferer, while the collection referrer is stored in the referrers[edition_]. We could prove it by take a look how the collectionFee is calculated 

```solidity
uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]);
```
# Proof of Concept
```solidity
function setUp() public {
        feeManager = new FeeManager(address(1), address(this), address(new MockSplitFactory()));
    }

function test_collectMintFeeBug() public {
        /** PoC 
         * 1. Deploy the feeManager
         * 2. SetUp the attributions/allocations/splitFactory. It is done so the creator and attributors could receive the fees.
         * 3. CreateRoute. It is done to set a collection referrer, who refers the creation of a new Edition, and gets a cut of all mint fees for that Edition
         * 4. Create a mint refferer. Who refers a mint, and gets a cut of the mint fee for that mint.
         * 5. Test, to show that all the fee go to the mint refferer, instead of mint refferer & collection referrer.

        attributions[0] = Target({chainId: 1, target: address(1)});
        attributions[1] = Target({chainId: 2, target: address(2)});

        address[] memory recipients = new address[](3);
        recipients[0] = address(0xc0ffee);
        recipients[1] = attributions[0].target;
        recipients[2] = attributions[1].target;

        uint256[] memory allocations = new uint256[](3);
        allocations[0] = 750_000;

        allocations[2] = 125_000;

        MockSplitFactory splitFactory =
            MockSplitFactory(payable(address(feeManager.splitFactory())));
        vm.expectCall(
            address(splitFactory),
            abi.encodeCall(
                splitFactory.createSplit,
                (
                    SplitV2Lib.Split({

                        distributionIncentive: 0
                    }),
                    address(feeManager),
                    address(0xc0ffee)
                )
            )
        );

        Target memory receiver = feeManager.createRoute(IEdition(address(mockEdition)), 1, attributions, address(7777));
        assertEq(receiver.target, address(feeManager.splitFactory()));
        assertEq(feeManager.feeReceiver(IEdition(address(mockEdition)), 1).target, receiver.target);
        assertEq(feeManager.referrers(IEdition(address(mockEdition))), address(7777));

        address Edition = feeManager.referrers(IEdition(address(mockEdition)));
        assertEq(feeManager.referrers(IEdition(address(mockEdition))), address(7777));
       
        address _refferer = address(1);
        
        feeManager.collectMintFee{value: 1 ether}( IEdition(address(mockEdition)), 1, 1, address(this), address(_refferer));

        console.log("The _refferer balance after the fee collection,", address(_refferer).balance);
        console.log("The edition refferer balance after the fee collection", address(7777).balance);
    }
```

## Impact
The collectionReferrerShare will not receive the fees, while the mintReferrer(_referrer) could receive x2 fees. Note that _referrer could be any arbitrary address.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
When you _route the collectionReferrerShare use the referrers[edition_] instead of _referrer.
