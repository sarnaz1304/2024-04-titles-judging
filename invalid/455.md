# Front-Running Vulnerability in `revokeRoles` Function

## Summary

The `revokeRoles` function in the `TitlesGraph` contract could be susceptible to a front-running attack. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `revokeRoles` function is designed to remove roles from a given address (`guy`). This function checks if the sender (`msg.sender`) has the `ADMIN_ROLE`, allowing them to revoke roles from others. However, because transactions are visible in the mempool before being executed, a malicious actor with access to another admin account could potentially observe a legitimate role-revocation transaction and front-run it by either changing the roles or permissions of the target or by performing another sensitive action that depends on the target's roles.

```solidity
/// @notice Override the {OwnableRoles} implementation to extend access to the `ADMIN_ROLE`.
/// @param guy The address from which to revoke the roles.
/// @param roles The roles to revoke.
/// @dev This function is used to revoke roles from an address and will revert if the caller is not the owner and does not have the `ADMIN_ROLE`.
function revokeRoles(address guy, uint256 roles)
    public
    payable
    override
    onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE)
{
    _removeRoles(guy, roles);
}
```

## Impact

This can compromise the integrity of the contract's operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a two-step process for sensitive administrative actions like role changes.
