# Broken Assumtion of timeFrame behaviour

## Summary
As far as I understand from personal correspondence with the protocol team, the following is assumed to be invariant
`Work.opensAt < work.closesAt`. However, the protocol does not validate this in any way when creating a work, nor when changing the timeFrame in the [`Edition.sol::setTimeFrame`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L401-L401) function

Thus, the invariant can easily be violated by the user, intentionally or unintentionally

## Vulnerability Detail
When a new job is created or the creator wants to change the timeFrame, work.opensAt and work.closesAt are not validated in any way

Creating a job
```solidity
function publish(
        address creator_,
        uint256 maxSupply_,
        uint64 opensAt_,
        uint64 closesAt_,
        Node[] calldata attributions_,
        Strategy calldata strategy_,
        Metadata calldata metadata_
    ) external override onlyRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE) returns (uint256 tokenId) {
        tokenId = ++totalWorks; // first increments, then assigns

        _metadata[tokenId] = metadata_;
        works[tokenId] = Work({
            creator: creator_,
            totalSupply: 0,
            maxSupply: maxSupply_,
            opensAt: opensAt_,
            closesAt: closesAt_,
            strategy: FEE_MANAGER.validateStrategy(strategy_)
        });
...
```
timeFrame change
```solidity
function setTimeframe(uint256 tokenId, uint64 opensAt, uint64 closesAt) external {
        Work storage work = works[tokenId];
        if (msg.sender != work.creator) revert Unauthorised();

        // Update the open and close times for the work
        work.opensAt = opensAt;
        work.closesAt = closesAt;

        emit TimeframeUpdated(address(this), tokenId, opensAt, closesAt);
    }
```

## Impact
Since the Readme says to report broken invariants, I included it in the bug, especially in combination with the issue described [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles-BengalCatBalu/issues/1) Title: `The work creator can manipulate FeeSize using front-running`, it gives even more power to work.creator

For example, it can easily turn off mint for a certain interval, just by changing the timeFrame once, making opensAt > closesAt, checkTime will revert the transaction exactly at the interval (closesAt, opensAt)

```solidity
function _checkTime(uint64 start_, uint64 end_) internal view {
        if (block.timestamp < start_ || (end_ != 0 && block.timestamp > end_)) {
            revert NotOpen(start_, end_);
        }
    }
```
