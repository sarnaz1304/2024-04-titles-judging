# Referrers can DoS minting

## Summary
Every time a new token is minted referrers are sent some ETH, which can lead to reverts and blocking minting.
## Vulnerability Detail
Minting in `Edition.sol` will make a [call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L236C1-L238C11) to `FeeManager.sol` and fee manager will route protocol fees to referrers using solady's `SafeTransferLib::safeTransferETH`, this will revert if the target reverts. For "mint referrers" users can opt to not include that particular referrer but there exists no way to evade collection referrers which gives collection referrers the ability to revert calls thus blocking every mint of a collection.

## Impact
Collection referrers can block minting of collections they are referred in.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding functionality to change collection referrers or use `forceSafeTransferETH` from SafeTransferLib.
