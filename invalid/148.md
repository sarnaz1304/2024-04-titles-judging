# FeeManager's admin cannot grant or revoke any role

## Summary

The `FeeManager` contract lacks an interface for the admin to grant or revoke roles.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contest's README states:
```bash
ADMIN_ROLE
...
On FeeManager, this role can:
...
3) Grant or revoke any role to/from any address (`grantRole`, `revokeRole`).
```

The `FeeManager` contract, inherited from solady's `OwnableRoles` contract, only permits the owner to manage roles.

```solidity
/// @dev Allows the owner to grant `user` `roles`.
/// If the `user` already has a role, then it will be a no-op for the role.
function grantRoles(address user, uint256 roles) public payable virtual onlyOwner {
    _grantRoles(user, roles);
}

/// @dev Allows the owner to remove `user` `roles`.
/// If the `user` does not have a role, then it will be a no-op for the role.
function revokeRoles(address user, uint256 roles) public payable virtual onlyOwner {
    _removeRoles(user, roles);
}
```

The `FeeManager` contract itself does not provide any interfaces that enable the admin to grant or revoke roles.

## Impact

The admin cannot grant or revoke any roles. This limitation cannot be changed since the contract is not upgradable. A new role can only be granted or revoked by the owner, which is the `TitlesCore` contract, and it also lacks the corresponding functions.

## Recommendation

Implement admin interfaces to manage roles

```solidity
function grantRoles(address guy, uint256 roles)
    public
    payable
    override
    onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE)
{
    _grantRoles(guy, roles);
}

function revokeRoles(address guy, uint256 roles)
    public
    payable
    override
    onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE)
{
    _removeRoles(guy, roles);
}
```
