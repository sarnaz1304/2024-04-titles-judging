# There are some useless functions in `Edition.sol`.

## Summary

`Edition::grantRoles` and `Edition::promoMint` functions are useless as there is no implementation logic to invoke them.

## Vulnerability Detail

As seen at `L427` of `Edition::grantRoles`, the caller must possess the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE`.

```solidity
    function grantRoles(address user_, uint256 roles_)
        public
        payable
        override
427     onlyRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE)
    {
        _grantRoles(user_, roles_);
    }
```

However, the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` is solely assigned to `TitlesCore.sol`, which lacks the implementation logic to invoke `Edition::grantRoles`.

And as you can see at `L329`, `Edition::promoMint` can only be accessed by someone holding the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` or `EDITION_MINTER_ROLE`.

```solidity
    function promoMint(address[] calldata receivers_, uint256 tokenId_, bytes calldata data_)
        external
329     onlyOwnerOrRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE | EDITION_MINTER_ROLE)
    {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
            _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, 1, data_);
        }
    }
```

However, since `Edition::grantRoles` is never invoked, there is no one who possesses the `EDITION_MINTER_ROLE`. Additionally, `TitlesCore.sol` that possesses `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` has no implementation logic to call `Edition::promoMint`.

## Impact

The promotinoal purpose can't be achieved.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There should be an improved mechanism for granting roles.
