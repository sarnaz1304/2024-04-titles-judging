# A user can bypass all fees for publishing and minting due to an edge case

## Summary
See detail. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Since the functions `TitlesCore.publish()`, `Edition.mint()`, `Edition.mintBatch()` do not explicitly enforce the fee to be provided in `msg.value`, it assumes that the call would revert within `FeeManager.collectMintFee` and `FeeManager.collectCreationFee` due to insufficient eth when routing the funds to the fee recipient. 

However, the documentation in the `FeeManager` contract clearly states that there is a possibility for ether to be stuck in the `FeeManager` contract:
```solidity
/// @notice An escape hatch to transfer any trapped assets from the contract to the given address.
```
Due to this, calling `TitlesCore.publish()` and the other functions will not revert even though `msg.value == 0`, since the `FeeManager` has residual funds which would be paid to the fee recipient, allowing the current user to not provide the fee along with their call to the stated functions.

## Impact
Users can publish titles and mint editions with 0 fee, so they can mint unlimited editions with no additional cost which breaks core protocol functionality.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Explicitly enforce the payment of fees, by checking that `msg.value == feeRequired` and reverting if that is not the case.
