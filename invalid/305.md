# Protocol will not work on most of the supported blockchains due to hardcoded ETH contract address.

## Summary
The Eth address is hardcoded in the `Common.sol`` file.
## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the README.md, the protocol will be deployed on the following blockchains-Ethereum, Base, OP, Zora, Blast, Arbitrum, zkSync, Degen. Most functionalities will not work as a result of the hardcoded `ETH_Address`
```solidity
address constant ETH_ADDRESS = address(0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE);

```

## Impact
Protocol will not work on most of the supported blockchains.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Deploy a registry contract that maps chain identifiers (like network IDs or names) to contract addresses. This way, your main contract can query the registry to get the correct address for each chain
