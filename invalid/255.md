# `Edition._refundExcess()` allows a malicious user to steal the entire Edition contract balance by only paying the minimum fee

## Summary

`Edition._refundExcess()` allows for stealing the entire balance by only paying for the minimum fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Edition._refundExcess()` should be used only to "Refund any excess ETH sent to the contract".

However, a malicious user can monitor the contract balance, and call `Edition.mint()`, minting a fee-free token, every time the contract balance is greater than the minimum minting fee, allowing to steal the excess balance.

```solidity
    /// @notice Mint a new token for the given work.
    /// @param to_ The address to mint the token to.
    /// @param tokenId_ The ID of the work to mint.
    /// @param amount_ The amount of tokens to mint.
    /// @param referrer_ The address of the referrer.
    /// @param data_ The data associated with the mint. Reserved for future use.
    function mint(
        address to_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address referrer_,
        bytes calldata data_
    ) external payable override {
        FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
            this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy
        );

        _issue(to_, tokenId_, amount_, data_);
❌      _refundExcess();
    }
```
```solidity
    /// @notice Refund any excess ETH sent to the contract.
    /// @dev This function is called after minting tokens to refund any ETH left in the contract after all fees have been collected.
    function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
❌          msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```

This attack is particularly feasible on Layer 2 (L2) blockchains where gas fees are low, making frequent monitoring and transactions economically viable.

### Scenario

1. Increased Contract Balance: Legitimate users or admins perform transactions that include a higher `msg.value` than required for operations like `TitlesCore.createEdition()`, `TitlesCore.publish()`, `Edition.grantRoles()`, or `Edition.revokeRoles()`. This increases the ether balance of the Edition contract, for instance, up to `0.1 ether`.

2. Minimum Protocol Fee: The minimum protocol fee required to mint a token is `0.0006 ether` for tokens with `mintFee = 0`.

3. Exploitation by Malicious User: A malicious user, let's call him Bob, continuously monitors the Edition contract's ether balance. Whenever the balance exceeds `0.0006 ether`, Bob initiates a transaction to `Edition.mint()` with exactly `0.0006 ether`. Because of how `_refundExcess()` is implemented, he not only mints the token but also receives the excess ether above `0.0006 ether` as a refund.

## Impact

Theft of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the `payable` modifier of `Edition.grantRoles()` and `Edition.revokeRoles()` and add a call to `Edition._refundExcess()` at the end of `TitlesCore.createEdition()` and `TitlesCore.publish()` to ensure that the Edition contract balance never accumulates.
