# The creator of a work can steal excess ETH sent by the user

## Summary
Inside `Edition.sol` there is a function `setFeeStrategy()` that allows the creator of a work to update the fee strategy for it. This allows him to change the `mintFee` and steal excess ETH send by a user.
```solidity
function setFeeStrategy(uint256 tokenId_, Strategy calldata strategy_) external {
        if (msg.sender != works[tokenId_].creator) revert Unauthorized();
        works[tokenId_].strategy = FEE_MANAGER.validateStrategy(strategy_);
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is an example of how this could happen:
1. Alice wants to mint 1 token for a given work. The `mintFee` is set to 0.9 ETH.
2. Alice calls `mint()` with 1 ETH as msg.value because she trusts that the protocol will return the excess 0.1 back to her because `_refundExcess()` function is part of the code for the `mint()` function.
```solidity
function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
3. The creator of the work sees Alice's transaction and front runs her by calling `setFeeStrategy()` and setting the `mintFee` for the work to 1 ETH
4. Alice doesn't get any excess amount back and all of her 1 ETH goes to paying the fees for the token mint. She lost 0.1 ETH

## Impact
Minters can lose the excess amount of ETH that they have provided because they trust that the system will refund them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Don't allow the creator to change `mintFee` or don't allow the user to send more ETH than needed.
