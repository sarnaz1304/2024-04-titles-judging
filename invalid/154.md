# User will not be able to publish new works even if he has the appropriate role

## Summary
Using the `grantPublisherRole()` from `Edition.sol` a user can be given the `EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE` which according to the comments should allow him to publish new works within the Edition:
```solidity
    /// @notice Grant the publisher role to the given address, allowing it to publish new works within the Edition.
    /// @param publisher_ The address to grant the role to.
    /// @dev This function is used by the owner or manager to grant the {EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE} to an address, allowing it to publish new works within the Edition.
    function grantPublisherRole(address publisher_)
        external
        onlyRolesOrOwner(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE)
    {
        _grantRoles(publisher_, EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE);
    }
```
However he still won't be able to publish new works because the wrong modifier is used in `publish()`

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that only the `EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE` can call the `publish()` function:
```solidity
function publish(
        address creator_,
        uint256 maxSupply_,
        uint64 opensAt_,
        uint64 closesAt_,
        Node[] calldata attributions_,
        Strategy calldata strategy_,
        Metadata calldata metadata_
    ) external override onlyRoles(EDITION_MANAGER_ROLE) returns (uint256 tokenId) {
```
This means that even if a user is given the `EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE` he still won't be able to publish any works because of this modifier.

## Impact
No new users will be able to publish works to the edition
