# MintBatch function not working

## Summary

MintBatch function not working

## Vulnerability Detail

The MintBatch function cannot be used normally. The reason is that when users use MintBatch for loop casting, they need to send the amount to the FeeManager. However, the problem occurs in that the eth of `msg.value` is sent to the FeeManager in each loop. This occurs in the second loop. , it will cause the amount in the Edition contract to be insufficient, making this function unable to run normally.

The following is the implementation code of mintBatch:
