# Refund dust ether to publisher when publish one work

## Summary
When one publisher publishes one work in one edition, the left ether except creation fee is needed to refund to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
When one publisher publishes one work in one edition, he will send some ether to pay for the creation fees. If the ether user send is larger than the creation fee, the left ether should be refunded to the user. Currently, all msg.value is sent to FEEMANAGER.

```c
    function publish(Edition edition_, bytes calldata payload_, address referrer_)
        external
        payable
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        if (!edition_.hasAnyRole(msg.sender, EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE)) {
            revert Unauthorized();
        }
        WorkPayload memory payload = abi.decode(payload_.cdDecompress(), (WorkPayload));
        return _publish(edition_, payload, referrer_);
    }
    function _publish(Edition edition_, WorkPayload memory work_, address referrer_)
        internal
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        ...
        // Collect the creation fee
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        feeManager.collectCreationFee{value: msg.value}(edition_, tokenId, msg.sender);
        ...
    }

```
## Impact
Dust ether is not refunded to the publisher.
