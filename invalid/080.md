# The _refundExcess function cannot refund

## Summary

The _refundExcess function cannot refund because there is no excess amount in the Edition contract

## Vulnerability Detail

The _refundExcess function cannot perform a normal refund because when calling `collectMintFee`, all the amount sent by the user has been sent to FeeManager for storage, which will cause the user to lose the amount. However, since the administrator can be contacted to call `FeeManager::withdraw `function, so the user's amount can be refunded, so I judge this vulnerability as Medium.

## Impact

The refund function cannot refund
