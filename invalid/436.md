# `Edition::mintWithComment` should emit author of the work, not receiver of the token

## Summary
`Edition::mintWithComment` emits `to_` as an author of the work, but `to_` is a token receiver

## Vulnerability Detail
`Edition::mintWithComment` Comment emission is read off-chain. Its 3rd argument should be the author, not the token receiver. It seems that msg.sender is a work's author, thus it should emit `msg.sender` as an author

## Impact
Not correct emit information about Comment
