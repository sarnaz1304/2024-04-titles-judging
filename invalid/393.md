# Incorrect Referrer Address in Fee Routing

## Summary

The `_splitProtocolFee` function incorrectly uses the transaction referrer's address instead of the collection's designated referrer when routing collection referrer shares.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_splitProtocolFee` function within the `FeeManager` contract, there is an error where the `collectionReferrerShare` of the fee is being routed to the transaction referrer (`referrer_`) instead of the collection's assigned referrer (`referrers[edition_]`).

## Impact

This is a high severity issue as the designated collection referrer never receives their share of the fees.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L436-L440

```solidity
        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Correct the implementation of `_splitProtocolFee` to ensure that `collectionReferrerShare` is routed to the correct referrer address stored in `referrers[edition_]` instead of the transaction referrer.
