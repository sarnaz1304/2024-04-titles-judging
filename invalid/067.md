# Future integrations requiring `mintBatch()` will be broken

## Summary
Future integrations requiring `mintBatch()` will be broken

## Vulnerability Detail
`mintBatch()` is supposed to pay separate mint fees based on each item in the batch, but it uses `msg.value` for each loop, rather than sending only the portion specific to that batch entry. After the first iteration of the loop, there will be no more funds to transfer, and it will have over-sent for the first entry in the batch.

## Impact
The `mintBatch()` function is effectively broken. The README states:

```markdown
### Q: Should potential issues, like broken assumptions about function behavior, be reported if they could pose risks in future integrations, even if they might not be an issue in the context of the scope? If yes, can you elaborate on properties/invariants that should hold?
Yes.
```
and any future integration that requires this function will be broken.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: src/editions/Edition.sol

283          for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
284              Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];
285  
286              // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
287 @>           FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
288                  this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
289              );
290  
291              _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
292              _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
293:         }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Send `amounts_[i]` rather than `msg.value` for each iteration
