# Lack of Address Checks leads to multiple funcionalities breaking

## Summary
Although `address(0)` usually is a 'banal' finding most of the time. In some scenarios, it can lead to a complete system crash.

## Vulnerability Detail
`TitlesCore.sol::initialize` is wrongly called with an address(0) passed as the `feeReceiver_` param, the contract will initialize correctly and also will transmit the address(0) as param on the deploy of `FeeManager`.

This will also pass unnoticed. Every time the `TitleCore.sol::createEdition` is called with the compromised feeManage, a new Edition will be created with the address(0) as the `protocolFeeReceiver` address. So on, so forth.

The problem is that none of the contracts implements a function to update this information, even the `TitlesCore.sol`

## Impact
All the collections created with the compromised fee manager will send all the protocol fees to the address(0). So, the impact is loss of protocol income.

## Code Snippet
The problem vector: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol#L44-L49
The affected functions: All functions that receive payments.
