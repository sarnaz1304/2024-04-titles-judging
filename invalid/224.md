# [M-3] Unused return value from `GRAPH.createEdge` in `Edition.publish` (Incorrect Error Handling + Potential Inconsistency)

## Summary
The `Edition.publish` function calls `GRAPH.createEdge` to create an edge in the `TitlesGraph` contract, but it ignores the return value from the `createEdge` function. This can lead to incorrect error handling and potential inconsistencies in the graph structure if the edge creation fails silently.

## Vulnerability Detail
Add this code to `Edition.t.sol`
```javascript 
contract MockGraph {
    function createEdge(Node memory, Node memory, bytes memory) external returns (bool) {
        return false; // Always return false to simulate failure
    }
}

contract EditionTest is Test {
    // ...

    function testExploit_UnusedReturnValue() public {
        // Create a new MockGraph instance
        MockGraph mockGraph = new MockGraph();

        // Deploy a new Edition contract with the MockGraph instance
        Edition exploitedEdition = new Edition();
        exploitedEdition.initialize(
            feeManager,
            TitlesGraph(address(mockGraph)),
            address(this),
            address(this),
            Metadata({label: "Exploited Edition", uri: "ipfs.io/exploited-edition", data: new bytes(0)})
        );

        // Call the publish function
        exploitedEdition.publish(
            address(1),
            10,
            0,
            0,
            new Node[](0),
            Strategy({
                asset: address(0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE),
                mintFee: 0.01 ether,
                revshareBps: 2500,
                royaltyBps: 250
            }),
            Metadata({label: "Unused Return Value", uri: "ipfs.io/unused-return-value", data: new bytes(0)})
        );

        // The test passes if no assertion fails, indicating that the return value is not being used
    }
}
```
In this test case:

1. We create a `MockGraph` contract that always returns false from the `createEdge` function.
2. We deploy a new Edition contract with the `MockGraph` instance.
3. We call the `publish` function on the `exploitedEdition` contract.
4. The test passes, proving that the return value from `createEdge` is not being used.

## Impact
If the `createEdge` function in the `TitlesGraph` contract returns false or encounters an error, the `Edition.publish` function will continue executing without handling the failure case. This can result in an inconsistent state where the `Edition.sol` contract believes the edge was created successfully, but it was actually not created in the `TitlesGraph`. 

This vulnerability can cause:
1. Inconsistencies in the graph structure.
2. It could result in broken relationships between nodes, where the `Edition.sol` contract assumes that an edge has been created successfully, but in reality, it hasn't been reflected in the `TitlesGraph`
3. Unintended behavior and other security vulnerabilities
4. Even if the inconsistencies in the graph structure do not lead to critical issues, (which it probably will, especially over time) they can still increase the maintenance and debugging efforts for the development team.

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that all the return values of the function calls are used.
