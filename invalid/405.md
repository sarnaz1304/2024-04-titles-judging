# Referral system can be gamed as editions and works are free to chose any `referrer` they want

## Summary

Referrals send a share of the protocol fee, so they should not be chosen arbitrarly by users or the protocol risks losing yield without benefitting from having real referrals.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `TitlesCore::createEdition()`, `referrer_` is sent as an argument, so the creator of the `edition` is able to set the `referrer` to an address on its control. `Edition::mint()` and `Edition::mintWithComment()` receive the `referrer_` as arguments, so the buyer can set it to an address it controls.

## Impact

Loss of fees for the protocol and lack of benefit from the referral system.

## Recommendation

Users should send a signature signed by a trusted wallet of the `Titles` protocol confirming that they are actually using a referral. This would make it such that the protocol would only lose fees to referrals if they were actually used.
