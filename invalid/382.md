# Incorrect Handling of Mint Fees in `Edition::mintBatch` Function

## Summary

The [Edition::mintBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L304) function is designed to mint a token to set of receivers for the given work. However mint fee is set incorrectly and protocol collects less fee than it should do.

## Vulnerability Detail


The [Edition::mintBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L304) function is designed to allow minting of a token to a set of receivers for the given work. However, the current implementation of the function incorrectly handles the mint fees, resulting in the protocol collecting less fee than it should.

The current implementation of the `Edition::mintBatch` function is as follows:

```soldity
Edition.sol
304: function mintBatch(
305:         address[] calldata receivers_,
306:         uint256 tokenId_,
307:         uint256 amount_,
308:         bytes calldata data_
309:     ) external payable {
310:         // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
311:         FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
312:             this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy //@audit amount is set incorrectly
313:         );
314: 
315:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
316:             _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
317:         }
318: 
319:         _refundExcess();
320:     }

```

As evident from the provided code, at [L312](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L312) the function is set to collect the mint fee according the `amount_`. Additionally, the function sends `amount_` number of tokens to each receiver, resulting in a total number of tokens minted that is equal to `receivers_length * amount_`.

However, the current implementation only collects the mint fee for the `amount_` number of tokens, rather than the full quantity minted. This discrepancy will result in a financial loss for the protocol.

## Impact

Due to the incorrect setting of `amount_` in the [Edition::mintBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L304) function implementation, minters may be able to mint a significantly higher number of tokens than they are intended to receive. This discrepancy would result in a financial loss for the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to fix the function as follows:
```diff
Edition.sol
304: function mintBatch(
305:         address[] calldata receivers_,
306:         uint256 tokenId_,
307:         uint256 amount_,
308:         bytes calldata data_
309:     ) external payable {
310:         // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
311:         FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
-312:             this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
+                 this, tokenId_, amount_ * receivers_.length, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
313:         );
314: 
315:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < receivers_.length; i++) {
316:             _issue(receivers_[i], tokenId_, amount_, data_);
317:         }
318: 
319:         _refundExcess();
320:     }
```
