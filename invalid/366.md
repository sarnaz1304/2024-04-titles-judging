# `FeeManager::_buildSharesAndTargets` could casue a DoS

## Summary
In the `FeeManager::_buildSharesAndTargets` function, there's a potential for creating an `attributions` configuration where the total share percentage exceeds 100%. This could result in a denial of service (DoS) if the Splits contract reverts due to over-allocation during fee distribution, or it could lead to some referrers not receiving their share of the mintFee because the allocated funds would be insufficient to cover all payouts.

## Vulnerability Detail
The main issue is in how the function calculates and then populates the `shares` array without verifying that the cumulative addition of `attributionRevShare` values does not surpass 100%. Assume all calculations are correct and we have an `attributions.length` of 5 and their share percentage is 25%. The total percentage of the `shares` array is now 125%. This will lead to operational issues.

```solidity
    function _buildSharesAndTargets(
        ...
        uint32 attributionShares = uint32(attributions.length);
        uint32 attributionRevShare = revshareBps * 100 / attributionShares;
        uint32 creatorShare = 1e6 - (attributionRevShare * attributionShares);

        ...

        for (uint8 i = 0; i < attributionShares; i++) {
            targets[i + 1] = attributions[i].target;
            shares[i + 1] = attributionRevShare;
        }
    }
```

## Impact
DoS for minting a Work or Edition.
