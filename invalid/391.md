# `TitlesGraph::createEdge` should have access restriction to be called only by ADMIN_ROLE, but didn't

## Summary
In `TitlesGraph::createEdge` anyone can create edge, but it seems edges should be created only by ADMIN_ROLE

## Vulnerability Detail
Accordingly to docs, ADMIN_ROLE can "create new Edges at will (createEdges)". `createEdges` function has `onlyRolesOrOwner(ADMIN_ROLE)` modifier, that is correct. `createEdge` should also have this check. Now, every user can call it and create edge.

## Impact
Edges can be created by anyone in a big amount

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/graph/TitlesGraph.sol#L64
```solididty
    function createEdge(Node calldata from_, Node calldata to_, bytes calldata data_)
        external
        override
        returns (Edge memory edge)
    {
        if (!_isEntity(from_, msg.sender)) revert Unauthorized();
        return _createEdge(from_, to_, data_);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `onlyRolesOrOwner(ADMIN_ROLE)` modifier to the `createEdge` function
