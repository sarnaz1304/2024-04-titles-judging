# Potential Flaws in _refundExcess Function Leading to Overpayment and Gas Inefficiency

## Summary

The `_refundExcess` function in the contract has potential vulnerabilities that can lead to overpayment and gas inefficiency. Specifically, the function allows users to withdraw excess ETH, which could result in overpayment to the next user. Additionally, the function may leave dust amounts of ETH in the contract, leading to gas inefficiency.

## Vulnerability Detail

### 1. Risk of Overpayment

The `_refundExcess` function allows any user to withdraw excess ETH, which may result in overpayment if a user mistakenly sends ETH to the contract from an external source. The next user triggering the function could potentially withdraw more ETH than they should, receiving both their ETH and the previous user's excess ETH.

### 2. Gas Inefficiency

The function does not efficiently handle the contract's balance, potentially if dust amounts of ETH are left in the contract. This inefficiency can lead to increased gas costs when attempting to send these small amounts.

## Impact

The vulnerabilities in the `_refundExcess` function expose the contract to potential overpayments and gas inefficiency. These flaws can result in financial losses for users and increased transaction costs due to inefficient gas usage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address the identified vulnerabilities and enhance the security and efficiency of the `_refundExcess` function, the following mitigations are recommended:

### 1. Add a Minimum Withdrawal Amount

Implement a constant variable `MIN_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT` to set a minimum withdrawal amount, preventing users from withdrawing dust amounts of ETH.

```solidity
uint256 constant MIN_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT = 0.001 ether;

function _refundExcess() internal {
    uint256 excess = address(this).balance.sub(msg.value);
    if (excess > MIN_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT) {
        msg.sender.safeTransferETH(excess);
    }
}
```

### 2. Track Contract Balances

Before allowing any user to withdraw excess ETH, track the contract's balance before and after each deposit. This way, each user can only withdraw the excess ETH they are entitled to.

```solidity
// Implementation to track contract balances
```

### 3. Clear the Contract Balance After the Refund

After refunding the excess ETH to the user, ensure that the contract's balance is cleared to zero to prevent any further withdrawals.

```solidity
function _refundExcess() internal {
//After all code implementation
    if (address(this).balance > 0) {
        payable(owner()).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```

By implementing these recommended mitigations, the `_refundExcess` function should be safer and more gas-efficient, reducing the risk of overpayment and ensuring proper management of the contract's balance.
