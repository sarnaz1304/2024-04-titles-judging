# Users are not refunded extra eth

## Summary
The `Edition` contract attempts to refund its users who overspend when minting `Works` but it fails to do so.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_refundExcess` function is present in all minting functions within the `Edition` contract. The goal of this function is to refund users if they for some reason send excess ether to the contract when minting tokens. 
```solidity
    function _refundExcess() internal {
        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
        }
    }
```
However, this will not happen because the ether sent to `Edition` for minting tokens is immediately sent to the `FeeManager` contract. The `_refundExcess` function only attempts to give back any ether that lay dormant within the `Editions` contract when it should try to refund users if there is excess ether within the `FeeManager` contract.

PoC: this test will fail when trying to assert the user balance is equal to what we expect it should be if they were refunded and will log the balance of the `FeeManager` where we can see the extra funds sit. Run forge test --mt test_neverRefundedForMint -vvvv to see the full logs.

```solidity
    function test_neverRefundedForMint() public {
        address user = makeAddr("user");
        vm.deal(user, 1 ether);

        vm.prank(user);
        uint256 mintEth = 0.0106 ether * 5;
        uint256 extraEth = 0.069 ether;
        uint256 expectedUserBalanceAfterMint = 1 ether - mintEth; //extra eth should be sent back to user
        edition.mint{value: mintEth + extraEth}(address(1), 1, 5, address(0), new bytes(0));
        console.log("user balance: ", address(user).balance);
        console.log("edition balance: ", address(edition).balance);
        console.log("fee manager balance: ", address(feeManager).balance);
        assertEq(address(user).balance, expectedUserBalanceAfterMint);
        assertEq(edition.totalSupply(1), 5);
        assertEq(address(1).balance, 0.05 ether);
        assertEq(address(0xc0ffee).balance, 0.0030 ether);
    }
```

## Impact
Users never get refunded if they overspend ether as the protocol attempts to.

## Recommendation
Refund the user from the `FeeManager` contract or enable strict checks that the user can not overspend ether when minting tokens.
