# Funds cannot be withdrawn

## Summary
`FeeManager.sol::withdraw` function will always fail because of use of transferFrom in `FeeManager.sol::_transfer` function without any allowance.
## Vulnerability Detail
> Note - Although the contest readme has been updated from "supports both ETH and ERC20s" to "only supports ETH", but there is a line
"
Should potential issues, like broken assumptions about function behavior, be reported if they could pose risks in future integrations, even if they might not be an issue in the context of the scope? If yes, can you elaborate on properties/invariants that should hold?
 Yes.
"
The use of `transferFrom` in `FeeManager.sol::withdraw` function clearly indicates the intent of future ERC20 integration. Hence, this should be considered a valid issue. Kindly read the report fully before making any decision.


In the `FeeManager.sol::withdraw` function it calls `FeeManager.sol::_transfer` function, this then calls ERC20's `transferFrom` function. The problem with tranferFrom is, it needs to have `allowance` in order to transfer even if the `spender` and the `from` are same. So this transaction will always revert because of `ERC20InsufficientAllowance` error. Hence, funds will forever remain frozen in the contract.
```solidity
function withdraw(address asset_, uint256 amount_, address to_)
        external
        onlyRolesOrOwner(ADMIN_ROLE)
    {
        _transfer(asset_, amount_, address(this), to_);
    }
```
```solidity
function _transfer(address asset_, uint256 amount_, address from_, address to_) internal {
        if (asset_ == ETH_ADDRESS) {
            to_.safeTransferETH(amount_);
        } else {
            asset_.safeTransferFrom(from_, to_, amount_);
        }
    }
```

-Proof of Concept
Paste the following code in `FeeManagerTest` contract in `FeeManager.t.sol` file.
```solidity
import {ERC20Mock} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/mocks/token/ERC20Mock.sol"

    function testWithdraw() public {
        ERC20Mock eRC20Mock = new ERC20Mock();
        address user = makeAddr("user");
        eRC20Mock.mint(address(feeManager),1e18);
        vm.prank(address(1));            // prank as ADMIN
        bytes4 selector = bytes4(keccak256("TransferFromFailed()"));     
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(selector));
        feeManager.withdraw(address(eRC20Mock), 1e18, user);
    }
```
Run the test with the following command 
```bash
forge test --match-test testWithdraw -vvvv
```
The Output Call-Stack is
```bash

## Impact
Funds will be permanently frozen in the `FeeManager` contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `_transfer` function as follows
```solidity
    function _transfer(address asset_, uint256 amount_, address from_, address to_) internal {
        if (asset_ == ETH_ADDRESS) {
            to_.safeTransferETH(amount_);
        } else {
           if(from_ == address(this){
                asset_.safeTransfer(to_,amount_);
           }else{
            asset_.safeTransferFrom(from_, to_, amount_);
           }
        }
    }
```
