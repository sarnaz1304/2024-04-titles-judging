# Improper handling of `msg.value` in the `Edition::mintBatch` function

## Summary

The [Edition::mintBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L277) function is designed to mint multiple tokens for the given works and minter should send required amount of `Ether` as `msg.value`. However `msg.value` is used within a loop and it will try to pull much more `Ether` from `Edition` than sent from `minter`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Users are able to use the [Edition::mintBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L277) function to mint multiple tokens for the given works.
The current implementation of the `Edition::mintBatch` function is as follows:

```soldity
Edition.sol
277: function mintBatch(
278:         address to_,
279:         uint256[] calldata tokenIds_,
280:         uint256[] calldata amounts_,
281:         bytes calldata data_
282:     ) external payable {
283:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
284:             Work storage work = works[tokenIds_[i]];
285: 
286:             // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
287:             FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(// @audit msg.value within a loop
288:                 this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
289:             );
290: 
291:             _checkTime(work.opensAt, work.closesAt);
292:             _updateSupply(work, amounts_[i]);
293:         }
294: 
295:         _batchMint(to_, tokenIds_, amounts_, data_);
296:         _refundExcess();
297:     }


```

As evident from the provided code, at [L287](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L287) the `msg.value` is sent to the `FeeManager` contract multiple times within a loop. This implementation flaw could result in the unintended drainage of `Ether` from the `Edition` contract.

If the `Edition` contract has a sufficient Ether balance, more `Eth` is transfered to `FEE_MANAGER`. However, if the `Edition` contract's `Ether` balance is depleted, the `mintBatch` function will always revert due to insufficient funds.

## Impact

There are two potential impacts in the `Edition::mintBatch` function implementation:

- If the `Edition` contract has a sufficient `Ether` balance, minters may be able to drain the contract's `Ether` by calling the `mintBatch` function, effectively obtaining multiple items without paying the required amount of `Ether`.

- In the event the `Edition` contract does not have a sufficient `Ether` balance, any attempt to call the `mintBatch` function will always result in a revert due to insufficient funds.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to refactor the implementation of the [Edition::mintBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/d7f60952df22da00b772db5d3a8272a988546089/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L277) function to avoid the use of `msg.value` within a loop.
