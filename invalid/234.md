# `Edition._refundExcess`: misimplemented as funds aren't on `address(this)` but on `FEE_MANAGER`

## Summary

`Edition._refundExcess()` doesn't work correctly as the excess funds sent from the user are forwarded to the `FEE_MANAGER` and aren't on the `Edition` contract anymore.

## Vulnerability Detail

The different mint functions on the `Edition` contract end with a call to `_refundExcess()`.

Its implementations checks that the user sent funds, and sends back any excess stuck in the contract

```solidity
File: Edition.sol
512:     function _refundExcess() internal {
513:         if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
514:             msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
515:         } 
516:     }
```

However, the claim here is that funds from `msg.value` are actually all forwarded to the `FEE_MANAGER`:

```solidity
wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol:
  236:         FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
  237              this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, works[tokenId_].strategy

  262:         FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
  263              this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, referrer_, strategy


  287:             FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
  288                  this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy

  311:         FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
  312              this, tokenId_, amount_, msg.sender, address(0), works[tokenId_].strategy
```

If we look at `collectMintFee()`'s implementation, it will consume all `msg.value` without refunding anything, even in the even of `fee_.amount == 0`:

```solidity
File: FeeManager.sol
183:     function collectMintFee(
184:         IEdition edition_,
185:         uint256 tokenId_,
186:         uint256 amount_,
187:         address payer_,
188:         address referrer_
189:     ) external payable {
190:         _collectMintFee(
191:             edition_, tokenId_, amount_, payer_, referrer_, getMintFee(edition_, tokenId_, amount_)
192:         );
193:     }
...
366:     function _collectMintFee(
367:         IEdition edition_,
368:         uint256 tokenId_,
369:         uint256 amount_,
370:         address payer_,
371:         address referrer_,
372:         Fee memory fee_
373:     ) internal {
374:         if (fee_.amount == 0) return;
```

Therefore `address(this).balance` doesn't get increased on `Edition` for the users to claim the stored funds

## Impact

Funds are stuck

Users aren't refunded automatically as expected

Users may get freebies (funds that were actually stuck in `Edition` but aren't rightfully theirs to claim)

An admin-callable withdraw function exist on FeeManager but isn't supposed to be part of this refund process (still, it decreases the severity from High to Medium)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either move the function to `FeeManager` and pass the `msg.sender`'s address as a parameter
Or implement a refund mechanism on `FeeManager` sending back the excess on `Edition` which will then send back the excess on `msg.sender`
