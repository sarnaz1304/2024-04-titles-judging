# Failure to control the size of msg.value can result non-payment fees FOR CREATION being paid for money on the FeeManager contract rather than money attached to the transaction

## Summary
This problem is almost exactly the same as the other [problem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles-BengalCatBalu/issues/10) Problem Title: `Failure to control the size of msg.value can result non-payment fees FOR MINTINT being paid for money on the FeeManager contract rather than money attached to the transaction` I described.

In this case, the lack of validation of msg.value size occurs in the following function chains

`TitlesCore::createEdition` -> `TitlesCore::_publish` and `TitlesCore::publish` -> `TitlesCore::_publish`

Only in this case, the attacker can avoid paying a commission for creating the work rather than a mint nft.

## Vulnerability Detail
When publishing a work using TitlesCore, the [_publish](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/TitlesCore.sol#L120-L120) function calls 
```solidity.
feeManager.collectCreationFee{value: msg.value}(edition_, tokenId, msg.sender);
```
The user is expected to pay a fee of 0.0001 to create a job.  This can be seen in the function 
[`FeeManager::collectCreationFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L166-L166)
```solidity
    uint128 public protocolCreationFee = 0.0001 ether;

function collectCreationFee(IEdition edition_, uint256 tokenId_, address feePayer_)
        external
        payable
    {
        Fee memory fee = getCreationFee();
        if (fee.amount == 0) return;

        _route(fee, Target({target: protocolFeeReceiver, chainId: block.chainid}), feePayer_);
        emit FeeCollected(address(edition_), tokenId_, ETH_ADDRESS, fee.amount, 0);
    }

function _route(Fee memory fee_, Target memory feeReceiver_, address feePayer_) internal {
        // Cross-chain fee routing is not supported yet
        if (block.chainid != feeReceiver_.chainId) revert NotRoutable();
        if (fee_.amount == 0) return;

        _transfer(fee_.asset, fee_.amount, feePayer_, feeReceiver_.target);
    }
```
Again due to the lack of any validation on the input size, if the FeeManager account has 0.0001 ETH the user can invoke the transaction with absolutely no effort and it will succeed.

## Impact
The contribution of this problem is not as large as the similar problem I refer to above. Since here the amount of commission for which we do not pay is smaller. And also the whole commission goes to the feeReceiver, i.e. to the protocol, i.e. the protocol will not lose money directly.
However, it is still a breach of the intended behaviour
