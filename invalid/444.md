# msg.value used in for loop in mintBatch() will throw error

## Summary
As in protocol ,to mint multiple tokens for the given work, for loop is used. But in for loop to for collect mint fee ether has been used. And for that msg.value has been passed. this can create issue.

## Vulnerability Detail

"
FEE_MANAGER.collectMintFee{value: msg.value}(
this, tokenIds_[i], amounts_[i], msg.sender, address(0), work.strategy
);
"

this statement is used in for loop in mintBatch function .
when i will be 0 , at that time ether will be send.
Now when i will be 1 and onwards it will always give error beacuse 0 balance would be present and insuffiecient balance would come

## Impact

mintBatch() function would failed because of above explaination, and due to which to mint multiple tokens for multiple work would not work
