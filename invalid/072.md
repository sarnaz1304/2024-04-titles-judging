# Collection referrer fees are sent to the wrong address in `FeeManager.sol`

## Summary
The fee manager contract distributes fees to different parties, but the fees for collection referrer are sent to work referrer, causing colltion referrer to lose some fee rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
At the end of `_collectMintFee`, [`_splitProtocolFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/fees/FeeManager.sol#L412) is called to split and send protocol fees to related parties:

```solidity
    function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
        // @note amount = protocolShare
        // The creation and mint referrers earn 25% and 50% of the protocol's share respectively, if applicable
        // @note this referred is set by function caller
        uint256 mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount_, referrer_); // <=(1)
        uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]); // <=(2)
        referrerShare = mintReferrerShare + collectionReferrerShare;

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: amount_ - referrerShare}),
            Target({target: protocolFeeReceiver, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),  // <=(3)
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}), // <=(4)
            payer_
        );
    }
```

In (1) and (2), we can see mint referral and colletion referral fees are calculated based on percentages, and they take in two different address, for mint referrer, it comes from the `referrer_` parameter in the function, while collection referrer is from `referrers[edition_]`, this makes sense as those two may be different. But later when actually distributing rewards, in (3) and (4), we see the target is all set to `referrer_`, even for `collectionReferrerShare`. But it's supposed to send to `referrers[edition_]`, causing the original collection referrers to lose their deserved shares.


## Impact
Collection referrers can receive less or even no minting shares when edition gets minted.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _splitProtocolFee(
        IEdition edition_,
        address asset_,
        uint256 amount_,
        address payer_,
        address referrer_
    ) internal returns (uint256 referrerShare) {
        // @note amount = protocolShare
        // The creation and mint referrers earn 25% and 50% of the protocol's share respectively, if applicable
        // @note this referred is set by function caller
        uint256 mintReferrerShare = getMintReferrerShare(amount_, referrer_); // <=(1)
        uint256 collectionReferrerShare = getCollectionReferrerShare(amount_, referrers[edition_]); // <=(2)
        referrerShare = mintReferrerShare + collectionReferrerShare;

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: amount_ - referrerShare}),
            Target({target: protocolFeeReceiver, chainId: block.chainid}),
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: mintReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}),  // <=(3)
            payer_
        );

        _route(
            Fee({asset: asset_, amount: collectionReferrerShare}),
            Target({target: referrer_, chainId: block.chainid}), // <=(4)
            payer_
        );
    }
```

## Recommendation
Change the route target for collection referrer to `referrers[edition_]`.
