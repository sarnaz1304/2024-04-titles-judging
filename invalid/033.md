# referrers[edition] can be changed by any publisher roles

## Summary
Anyone who owns EDITION_PUBLISHER_ROLE can update `referrers[edition_]` variable.


## Vulnerability Detail
`referrers[edition_]` stands for the creation referrer. This variable should be updated once when someone creates one Edition.
However, `referrers[edition_]` will be updated when someone publishes one work in this edition.
```c
    function publish(Edition edition_, bytes calldata payload_, address referrer_)
        external
        payable
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        ...
        WorkPayload memory payload = abi.decode(payload_.cdDecompress(), (WorkPayload));
        return _publish(edition_, payload, referrer_);
    }
    /// @return tokenId The token ID of the new Work.
    function _publish(Edition edition_, WorkPayload memory work_, address referrer_)
        internal
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        // Publish the new Work in the Edition
        ......
        // Create the fee route for the new Work
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        Target memory feeReceiver = feeManager.createRoute(
            edition_, tokenId, _attributionTargets(work_.attributions), referrer_
        );
       ...
    }
    function createRoute(
        IEdition edition_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        Target[] calldata attributions_,
        address referrer_
    ) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) returns (Target memory receiver) {
        Target memory creator = edition_.node(tokenId_).creator;

       ......
        referrers[edition_] = referrer_;
    }
```

## Impact
The creation referrer might be changed in publish(), which could cause the initial creation referrer lost the related minted fee.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Once the creation referrer is updated in the createEdition(), the creation referrer should not be changed by publisher.
