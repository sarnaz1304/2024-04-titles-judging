# Possible loss of Ether during Edition creation

## Summary
A user who calls the `TitlesCore.createEdition()` is required to the pay the creation fee with Ether that is sent to the contract during function call. If the amount of Ether is larger than the required fee, then the remaining amount will stay on the `FeeManager`.
## Vulnerability Detail
During  `TitlesCore.createEdition()` eventually the `_publish()` gets called which will transfer the entire `msg.value` to the `FeeManager`:
```solidity
feeManager.collectCreationFee{value: msg.value}(edition_, tokenId, msg.sender);
```
The fee at the `FeeManager` shall be first calculated by the `getCreationFee()` and sent to the `protocolFeeReceiver` by the `_route()` function.

The excess Ether that is left on the `FeeManager` could either be withdrawn by the protocol team using `withdraw()` or it could be used by the next minter who could just supply the remaining Ether during minting so that his Ether sent + the Ether sitting on `FeeManager` could be just enough to satisfy the necessary fee amount.

## Impact
Loss of excess Ether by the Edition creator.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to send exact amount of ether by the `_publish()` function, the change would be: 
```diff
// Collect the creation fee
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
-        feeManager.collectCreationFee{value: msg.value}(edition_, tokenId, msg.sender);
+        feeManager.collectCreationFee{value: feeManager.getCreationFee().amount}(edition_, tokenId, msg.sender);
```
Next, excess Ether needs to be brought back to the `msg.sender` in similar way as it is done in the minting functions in `Edition`:
```diff
+function _refundExcess() internal {
+        if (msg.value > 0 && address(this).balance > 0) {
+            msg.sender.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
+        }
+    }
```

And the function call be added at the end of `_publish()`:

```diff
    function _publish(Edition edition_, WorkPayload memory work_, address referrer_)
        internal
        returns (uint256 tokenId)
    {
        [...]
        // Set the royalty target for the new Work
        // wake-disable-next-line reentrancy
        edition_.setRoyaltyTarget(tokenId, feeReceiver.target);
+       _refundExcess();
    }
```
