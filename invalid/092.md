# The creator may not receive the deserved fee.

## Summary

When the creator transfers, the change in fee receiver is not considered.

## Vulnerability Detail

When users call the `transferWork` function to transfer the Edition's creator to someone else, the fee receiver does not change accordingly, and there is no related set function in the feeManager. As a result, the new creator may lose the deserved amount.
