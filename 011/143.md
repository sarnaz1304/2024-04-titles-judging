# Works creators can front-run a mint to increase fee

## Summary

The function `Edition.setFeeStrategy()` can be called by a work creator in a front-running transaction before a mint to increase the fees in case the minter overpaid the ether value in hope to get reimbursed the overpaid amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `setFeeStrategy()` can be called at any time by a work creator:

```solidity
    function setFeeStrategy(uint256 tokenId_, Strategy calldata strategy_) external {
        if (msg.sender != works[tokenId_].creator) revert Unauthorized();
        works[tokenId_].strategy = FEE_MANAGER.validateStrategy(strategy_);
    }
```

This will set the value of `works[tokenId_].strategy.mintFee` to any desired value. This value will later be used to compute the mint fee in `FeeManager.getMintFee()`:
 
```solidity
    function getMintFee(Strategy memory strategy_, uint256 quantity_)
        public
        view
        returns (Fee memory fee)
    {
        // Return the total fee (creator's mint fee + protocol flat fee)
        return Fee({asset: ETH_ADDRESS, amount: quantity_ * (strategy_.mintFee + protocolFlatFee)});
    }
```

## Impact

In case a user overpaid a mint in hope to get reimbursed the overpaid amount, the creator of a work can front-run the transaction to increase the fee to receive more from the mint.

## Recommendation

Set a time delay for changing the fees or disable the reimbursement of overpaid amount to users after mints to make sure users send the exact amount they expect to pay.
