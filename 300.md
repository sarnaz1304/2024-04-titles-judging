# Lack of event in `FeeManager` contract when protocol fees are changed

## Summary
The `FeeManager` contract is responsible for calculating and collecting fees throughout the TITLES protocol. However, there is no event emitted when the protocol fees are changed. This can make it difficult to track changes in the protocol fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `setProtocolFees` function in `FeeManager` contract, important parameters are set and changed.

```javascript
    function setProtocolFees(
        uint64 protocolCreationFee_,
        uint64 protocolFlatFee_,
        uint16 protocolFeeShareBps_,
        uint16 mintReferrerRevshareBps_,
        uint16 collectionReferrerRevshareBps_
    ) external onlyOwnerOrRoles(ADMIN_ROLE) {
        if (
            protocolCreationFee_ > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE || protocolFlatFee_ > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE
                || protocolFeeShareBps_ > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS
                || (mintReferrerRevshareBps_ + collectionReferrerRevshareBps_) > MAX_BPS
        ) {
            revert InvalidFee();
        }
@>      protocolCreationFee = protocolCreationFee_;
@>      protocolFlatFee = protocolFlatFee_;
@>      protocolFeeshareBps = protocolFeeShareBps_;
@>      mintReferrerRevshareBps = mintReferrerRevshareBps_;
@>      collectionReferrerRevshareBps = collectionReferrerRevshareBps_;
    }
```

However, there is no event emitted when the protocol fees are changed, which makes it difficult to track these changes off-chain.

## Impact
There is a possibility that users would not be aware of protocol fee changes.

## Recommendation
Consider adding an event to `setProtocolFees` function in the `FeeManager` contract. The `ProtocolFeesChanged` event can be emitted with the new protocol fees as parameters.
