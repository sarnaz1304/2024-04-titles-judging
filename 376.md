# No Storage Gap for Upgradeable Contract Might Lead to Storage Slot Collision

## Summary
No Storage Gap for Upgradeable Contract Might Lead to Storage Slot Collision.

## Vulnerability Detail

`TitlesGraph` and `TitlesCore` are both upgradeable contracts. For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to "allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments" .Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. However, none of these contracts contain storage gap.


## Impact
Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts, potentially causing loss of user fund or cause the contract to malfunction completely.
