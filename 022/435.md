# Title: Incorrect Emitter Address in Comment Event Emission

## Summary
In the mintWithComment function, an event Comment is emitted with the author indexed as the address of the contract (address(this)). However, it should emit msg.sender as the author to accurately reflect who made the comment.

## Vulnerability Detail
The event Comment is emitted with the address of the contract (address(this)) as the author of the comment, which may not represent the actual sender of the transaction.

## Impact
This issue might mislead users or applications consuming the event data into believing that the contract itself made the comment, rather than the actual sender who invoked the mintWithComment function.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-titles/blob/main/wallflower-contract-v2/src/editions/Edition.sol#L269
```javascript
emit Comment(address(this), tokenId_, to_, comment_);

event Comment(
    address indexed edition, uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed author, string comment
);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the emission of the Comment event to use msg.sender as the author to accurately reflect the actual sender of the transaction
