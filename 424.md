# The user can add themselves as a referrer and receive fees, even though they are not a genuine referrer

## Summary
The user can add themselves as a referrer and receive fees, even though they are not a genuine referrer. Therefore it is possible to receive both mint referrer fees and collection referrer fees

## Vulnerability Detail

Although it is expected that users will interact with Editions through `TitlesCore.sol` this is not a guarantee, since the contracts are available and the crucial functions are marked as `external` (`mint `and `createEdition`). As such, the user can pass himself as a referrer for minting and collection creation. There is a missing check that msg.sender is not referrer at the same time in both `TitlesCore.sol` and `Edition.sol`

## Impact

Users can collect fees from protocol although they are not genuine referrers

## Code Snippet

One example of the impacted functions in `Edition.sol` would be `mint`.  But same is valid for other minting functions as well.

In `TitlesCore.sol` it could be `createEdition`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a `require `statement to check if the user has added themselves as a referrer.
`require(referrer_ != msg.sender, "Cannot add yourself as a referrer")
`
